                            Assembly Volume Test
                            --------------------

The purpose of this test is to excercise the functionality of the
G4AssemblyVolume class and compare it with the geometry created by
using of the G4PVPlacements only.

This test provides the possibility to vizualize the geometry with OpenGL.
