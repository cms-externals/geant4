----------------------------------------
- Renamed 'testNTST' in its CMakeLists.txt to 'altTestNTST', to avoid
  clash with target in benchmarks/calorimeter/NTST

-------------------------------------------  
- Added cross check of Dormand-Prince 4/5 against boost implementation
to validate its implementation and investigate deviations seen in
tests (and inquiry from mu2e.)   

- Revised testPropagateMagField to add Bulirsch-Stoer method (#99),
to check the modulus of momentum output in integration, and to report
more information in case of problem with overlong end-position.

----------------------------------------     - part of field-V10-03-YY
Moved output of all tests to a new subdirectory. (suggested by Dmitry)

New perl script to check output for points displaced further than step
 size.

November 1, 2017 J.Apostolakis               - fieldtest-V10-03-02

------------------------------               - part of field-V10-03-18
testProElectroMagField.cc
- Added new type of Integration Driver -- templated on the type of the Stepper.
     Run extra cases (both old type and new type of driver.)
- Output results with higher precision.
   ( Updated output results for test runs. )

June  2, 2017 J.Apostolakis                  - fieldtest-V10-03-00

---------------------------
- Added option for new embedded steppers to remaining sub-system tests:
        testProElectroMagField.cc
        testProPerpSpin.cc
        testPropagateSpin.cc

- Added output for new steppers for new steppers for the tests:
        testPropagateMagField.cc
        testProElectroMagField.cc
	
June  3, 2016 J.Apostolakis                  - part of field-V10-02-17
---------------------------
- Added runs for new steppers to all tests in test.sh !!

- Several changes in testPropagateMagField.cc:

    Changed to using Quad field as default.
    Choice of type of magnetic field can be done at runtime - in argv[5]
