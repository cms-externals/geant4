In this directory you can find the test for Geant4 Solids with Optical Photons.
The test was created from a user application in order to test the replay
of the Solids.

=============
How it works :
=============
 - The Solid is situated in the center of the World Volume.
   It can be choosen via macro command. 
 - The primary particle (e- of 20 veV) is shooting from Randomly Position on
   the Shpere around the Solid to the center of the World Volume.
 - This primary particle 'enters' in the Solid and create Optical Photons.
   The boundary between Solid and World is declared as Boundary with Reflection.
   If a optical Photon is going outside Solid, it is a Error.
   This error is detected, warning or error message is printed.
   This message also containts the information that can be useful for debugging:
   -Position p and Direction v of the Point  (Global Coordinates), were Error
    is detected.
   -Inside(p):
    If p is Inside, the DistanceToOut(p,v,norm) is given
    If p is Outside,the DistanceToIn(p,-v) is given
    If p is On the Surface, both values are given.

=====================
How to run this test :
=====================       

 To build the application, first setup your Geant4 environmental variables,
 do not forget to setup the visualisation part.

 and then do :                  make
 
 - to run it in batch mode:
     AXPETDemonstrator run1.mac
 - to run it in interactive mode:
     AXPETDemonstrator
   then execute one of the macros by:
     /control/execute run.mac
   or insert your commands.                          

==================================
 Via command line user can choose :
==================================

 the solids:   /mydet/SelectDetector nameOfSolid   
 the rotation: /mydet/RotateX angleInDegree
               /mydet/RotateY angleInDegree
               /mydet/RotateZ angleInDegree
 In case of Error(Optical Photon escaping Solid)
 warning or Abortion of the Run can be chosen.
 It can be useful for large statistics. 
 Coomand for Abort Run : /mydet/AbortRun 1

============                
The examples are given in run.mac(shooting 30 e- in all solids) 
============              run1.mac(shooting 3000 e- in shoosen solid, Ellipsoid)
                          run2.mac(shooting 3000 e- in shoosen solid,
                                   Shell=Subtraction of Spheres)
