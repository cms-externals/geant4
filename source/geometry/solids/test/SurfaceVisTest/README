*************************************************
 This is a test for the visualisation and testing
 of Points On the Surface of the solid

 Author: Tatiana Nikitina
*************************************************

This test was created for testing GetPointOnSurface()
Test runs as a normal Geant4 example.

 To build the application, first setup your environmental variables,
 do not forget to setup the visualisation part.

 and then do :                  make
 
 and to run it :
                                $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/SurfaceVisTest
                          
 SurfaceVisTest will do 2 tests on each run:
 - check point test for 1000 points 
   (test if the points given by GetPointOnSurface() are realy on the Surface using Inside())  
 - visualisation test of 1000 points generated on Surface of Generic Polyhedra.
   (draw points given by GetPointsOnSurface())

Via command line user can choose :
 the solis : /mydet/SelectDetector nameOfSolid   
 the number of Points generated on the Surface : /rndm/numPoints N

Examples are given in vis.mac or in run1.mac
