           History file for geometry/solids/test/SBT
	   -----------------------------------------
This file should be used to briefly summarize all major modifications
introduced in the code and keep track of all tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

May 17, 2016 - G.Cosmo
----------------------
- Fixed compilation errors on custom vis-manager...

Nov 28, 2012 - J.Apostolakis
----------------------------
- G4InteractiveSolid: changed 'BooleanSolid' command to 'SimpleBooleanSolid'
  to prepare for addition of a general boolean.

Apr 6, 2012 - M.Kelsey
----------------------
- Updated to new G4Exception scheme; fixed few typos...

Oct 31, 2011 - T.Nikitina
-------------------------
- Added missing solids G4GenericTrap, G4Paraboloid and G4CutTube to test.

Feb 18, 2008 - I.Hrivnacova
---------------------------
- Added missing solids in specific: G4Ellipsoid, G4EllipticalCone,
  G4EllipticalTube, G4ExtrudedSolid, G4Orb, G4TessellatedSolid, G4Tet,
  G4TwistedBox, G4TwistedTrap, G4TwistedTrd, G4TwistedTubs.
- Changed logger precision from 16 digits to 20, as 16 were not sufficient
  to reproduce the errors in debug.
- In DrawError():
  o draw the solid first, otherwise the command vis/viewer/set/style
    does not affect solid drawing.
  o draw volume only, if errorIndex=0.
- In TestOutsidePoint(): allow a difference within the surface tolerance
  for the distance of a point on surface.
- In DebugXX() methods: added printing of the tested values.
- Added method DebugSurfNorm().
- Corrected output of time string.

Nov 9, 2005 - G.Cosmo
---------------------
- Implemented migration to <sstream> from deprecated <strstream>.

Dec 1, 2003 - G.Cosmo
---------------------
- Updated vis-manager to recent visualisation drivers.
- Cleared compilation warnings...

Nov 18, 2003 - J.Apostolakis
----------------------------
- Attempted to update to changes in G4VisManager which require
  the objectTransformation (a G4Transform3D) for all Draw methods.

Jan 08, 2002 - G.Cosmo
----------------------
- Migrated SBTrun.cc and SBTvoxel.cc to Geant4 4.0.

Apr 20, 2001 - G.Cosmo
----------------------
- Updates for migration to STL vector, modified SBTrun.cc.

Jan 25, 2001 - E.Medernach
--------------------------
- Introduced program to process fatal execution error from Fred
  (new directory "process").

Dec 14, 2000 - E.Medernach
--------------------------
- Improved support for Boolean solids:
  o Modified: SBTrun.cc, G4InteractiveSolid[.hh.cc]
  o Updated "log" area.

Nov 09, 2000 - G.Cosmo
----------------------
- Cleaned up files and moved to new directories.

Aug 22, 2000 - E.Medernach
--------------------------
- Added parameter script support with automatic exit
- Added a directory for geant4 script and for log files

- Added the current solid in the log file (second line in the log file) 
  script to visualize errors with comment: ErrorView
