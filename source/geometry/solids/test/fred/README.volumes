README.volumes

Fred has several test volumes currently available.

Before run initialization, a test volume should be selected. Several
volumes are currently implemented. Unless otherwise specified, they have
dimensions of 1 m.

/fred/volume BOX              # a simple box
/fred/volume TUBS             # a tube of 1 m inner and 1.2 m outer radii
/fred/volume CONE             # a cone a 1 m inner and 1.2 m radii at one
                              # end and 0.4 m and 0.6 m radii at the other
/fred/volume PCON             # A polycone (crashes with beta 1)
/fred/volume PGON             # A eight sided polygon of 1 m inner and 
                              # 1.2 m outer transverse size
/fred/volume PGON2            # The same as above but rotated by 22.5 degrees
			      
For all volumes except BOX, a start phi angle and delta phi angle
can be specified by the commands:

/fred/startPhi <value degrees>
/fred/deltaPhi <value degrees>

By default, startPhi=0 and deltaPhi=360 (i.e. no phi segmentation).
