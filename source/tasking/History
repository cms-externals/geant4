- Added checks for currentRun before calling routines with currentRun
- updated docs using G4RunManagerCreator instead of G4RunManagerFactory
- G4WorkerTaskRunManager: minor tweaks to ProcessUI
- G4TaskRunManagerKernel: memory cleanup + initCmdStack

- Tasking stability fixes
- removed a bunch of excess functions from G4WorkerTaskRunManager
- Got rid of regular task group vs. TBB task group implementation
  - this is thanks to the generic execute_on_all_threads function

July 17th, 2020, I. Hrivnacova (tasking-V10-06-05)
- Adding call to G4VScoreNtupleWriter in G4WorkerTaskRunManager,
  which missing was causing a break in B4d basic example.

June 22nd, 2020, G. Cosmo (tasking-V10-06-04)
- Fixed recursive inclusion in G4TaskRunManager.

June 18th, 2020, G. Cosmo (tasking-V10-06-03)
- Added DLL macros for Windows build.
- Fixed cases of static inline methods and static symbols to export
  in G4TaskRunManager and G4RunManagerFactory. Some code cleanup for
  use of G4 types.
- Fixed compilation warnings for unused mutexes in G4TaskRunManager
  and G4WorkerTaskRunManager.

June 17th, 2020, G. Folger
- Fixes for Windows: in G4TaskRunManager, replaced direct access to
  static data by access functions.

June 10th, 2020, J. Madsen
- Updated README.md

- Fixed numberOfEventsPerTask < nworker reproducibility
- Migrated G4RunManagerCreator to own header/source
- cleaned up sources.cmake

June 4th, 2020, J. Madsen (tasking-V10-06-01)
- Added G4TaskRunManager constructor overload taking boolean
  for whether to use TBB
- Added warning if using TBB is requested but no compile support
- Default arguments in G4TaskRunManager query G4USE_TBB environment
  variable to set default bool
