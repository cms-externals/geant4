                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included since the last reference
tag are:

  o Removed obsolete electromagnetic/integral module. 
  o Implemented store/retrieve PhysicsTables in EM processes. 
  o Fixed old outstanding bug in G4EnergyLossTables, responsible for
    causing negative energy deposit in some rare occasions. 
  o Introduced fluorescence according to the new design into e- ionisation.
  o Introduced "Shell variables" for UI command handling and new
    UI commands.
