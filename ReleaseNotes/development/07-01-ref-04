                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Introduced first implementation for optional check of overlaps at
    construction to G4PVPlacement and G4PVParameterised volumes. Default
    resolution of 1000 points is defined for the check.
  o Archived old TRD parameterised models. Functionality now included
    in standard EM processes.
  o New MSC models (G4MultipleScattering80 and G4MscModel80) become the
    default. NOTE: these changes provide more precise simulation o sampling
    calorimeters (mean energy deposition and RMS) and much less cut/step
    dependent. It improves results for many other applications, however, a
    CPU penalty, whose entity depends on the geometry, is observed at the
    moment. For backward compatibility the process G4MultipleScattering71
    is included, it corresponds to multiple-scattering model as present in
    release 7.1.
  o Fixes for initialization and for angular distribution in
    G4MuBremsstrahlungModel and G4MuPairProductionModel.
  o New RayTracerX visualization driver selectable at build time.
