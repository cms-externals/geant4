                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last development tag are:

 o Follow-up of code-review for solids, implemented correction for solids
   with curved surfaces in DistanceToIn(p,v,...) to resolve precision issues
   detected on 64 bits systems for points very far from intersection (hundreds
   meters) and relatively small target solids.
 o Added interface to set deexcitation handler in Binary cascade.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

(o)  Fixes included in release 9.2.p02

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V09-02-07            (o)
------
- binmake.gmk: move definition of TARGOBJEXT to place not dependent
  on G4EXLIB such that the extension is defined when no lib is present
  (change required for upgrading exercisers in testing).

event                                            event-V09-02-01             (o)
-----
- Minor chnages to G4GeneralParticleSourceMessenger: now using full range
  of predefined units for length, energy and angle.
- Fixed gcc-4.4.0 compilation warning message for non-initialised variable
  in G4SPSEneDistribution.

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V09-02-04
-------------------
- Introduced to DistanceToIn(p,v) splitting of the distance for point very   (o)
  far from intersection area and big difference between solid dimensions and
  distance to it; resolves issue observed on 64 bits systems. Affected solids:
  G4Tubs, G4Cons, G4Sphere, G4Orb. Addresses problem report #1022.
- Fixed rare cases of NaN on G4Sphere.
- Fixed case of non-initialised start-Phi value in G4Tubs and G4Cons,
  introduced in previous tag.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V09-02-03     (o)
------------------------
- G4Ellipsoid: introduced to DistanceToIn(p,v) splitting of the distance for
  point very far from intersection area and big difference between solid
  dimensions and distance to it; resolves issue observed on 64 bits problem.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V09-02-14
----------------------------------
- G4WaterStopping: added Fe ion data.
- G4GoudsmitSaundersonMscModel: fixed unphysical peak at very small angles;
  extended model to 100 TeV.
- G4GoudsmitSaundersonTable: reduced size of generated object code.
- G4eCoulombScatteringModel, G4CoulombScatteringModel, G4WentzelVIModel:
  fixed kinematic for ion/ion scattering.

processes/hadronic
------------------
- models/binary_cascade (had-binary-V09-02-01)
  o Added interface to set deexcitation handler in G4BinaryLightIonReaction
    used to deexcite lighter initial nucleus; precompound handling low energy
    interactions can be set too.

track                                track-V09-02-03
-----
- Added method SetLowEnergyLimit() in G4ParticleChangeForLoss.

examples                                         examples-V09-02-05
--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- advanced/amsEcal (amsEcal-V09-02-08)
  o Updated DetectorConstruction for layers setup and PrintParameters().
  o RunAction, EventAction: fixed initialisation of vectors.
  o SteppingAction: added protection on index computation.
  o Moved trigger conditions from SteppingAction to EventAction.
  o Added histo 5 for geantino scan.
  o Compute pixel numbering directly in SteppingAction.
- extended/electromagnetic/TestEm5 (testem5-V09-02-05)
  o PhysicsList: removed obsolete low-energy EM builders, substituted by
    builders from physics_list module; added "standardGS" option: use
    GoudsmitSaunderson multiple-scattering model.
  o RunAction: fixed output of mean scattering angle.
- extended/field/field04 (fieldex04-V09-02-01)
  o Introduced '/rndm/autoSeed' command and changed default seeding of
    random generator.
- extended/hadronic/Hadr00 (exhadr00-V09-02-00)
  o Added possibility to define physics-list as a job parameter.
  o Added script for the test run of all physics-lists.
- extended/hadronic/Hadr01 (exhadr01-V09-02-01)
  o Substituted obsolete FB68 by FTFP_BERT_TRV.

tests                                            tests-V09-02-05
-----
- Updated reference outputs and tools.
- test34 (test34-V09-02-00)
  o Fixed warning message on error output about no cuts defined for
    region crystals.

      as a function of kinetic energy of the final state particle at certain
      fixed angles.
    + BNL experiment for the measurement of Lorentz invariant cross section as
      a function of reduced transverse mass in fixed rapidity bins.
