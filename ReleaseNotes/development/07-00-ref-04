                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Updated implementation for SurfaceNormal() on most CSG and boolean
    solids to adopt variant for edges/vertices.
  o Modified G4UIbatch to now abort execution of the macro file if commands
    are wrong or not existing.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V07-00-00
------
- Changed configuration for OPENGLXM to explicitely require OPENGLX.

geometry/management                              geommng-V07-00-04
-------------------
- G4LogicalVolume::SetVisAttributes(const G4VisAttributes& VA): now creating
  a copy of 'VA' on the heap. Temporary solution, until a proper 'store' for
  visualization attributes will be implemented to take care of the memory
  management.
- Modified comments in G4VSolid and G4BlockingList to overcome a limitation in
  the scripts for the generation of the Software Reference Manual.

geometry/solids/Boolean                          geom-bool-V07-00-03
-----------------------
- The new implementation of Inside() with surface-normal for edges/vertices
  is now the deafult one.

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V07-00-06
-------------------
- Updated implementation of SurfaceNormal(p) to get consistence with
  Inside(p) functions for the treatment of phi/theta surfaces.
  They are treated now in both functions in terms of kAngTolerance.
  The reason is that historically SurfaceNormal(p) was using only
  kCarTolerance for estimation of shortest distance to a surface. Now,
  following the new updated specification, the surface selection is made
  according to Inside(p) approach (as kSurface is selected), i.e. - for
  phi/theta surfaces in terms of kAngTolerance.
  The new implementation is now the default.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V07-00-04
------------------------
- G4TwistedSurface: fixed bug in GetAreaCode() affecting G4TwistedTubs.

global                                           global-V07-00-06
------
- Added new class G4AnalyticalPolSolver in HEPNumerics module, implementing
  the CACM algorithm for solving analytically a polynomial equation up to
  the 4th order.

graphics_reps                                    greps-V07-00-07
-------------
- Improved G4AttCheck and removed warning in implementation of
  G4Visible::SetVisAttributes(const G4VisAttributes&).

intercoms                                        intercoms-V07-00-02
---------
- Modified G4UIbatch so that it now aborts the execution of the macro file
  (and any other parent macro files which issued this macro file) if a
  command in the macro file is wrong or cannot be executed.
  Fixes problem report #734.

materials                                        materials-V07-00-05
---------
- Added SetGROUPVEL() in G4MaterialPropertiesTable.
  Addresses problem report #741.
- Trivial fix in G4IonisParamMat::FindMeanExcitationEnergy().
  Addresses problem report #746.
- Added acknowledgement to Nist classes.

processes/decay                                  decay-V07-00-00
---------------
- Fixed bug in G4Decay::AtRestGetPhysicalInteractionLength().
  Condition is now fixed to "Not Forced".

processes/transportation                         transport-V07-00-01
------------------------
- Added process type to G4Transportation.
  Addresses problem report #743.

run                                              run-V07-00-01
---
- Moved invocation of ConstructParticle() method back to the original
  place in InitializePhysics().

track                                            track-V07-00-01
-----
- Added new class G4ParticleChangeForGamma.
- Modified G4ParticleChangeForLoss to inline 'update' methods.
- Fix in G4Track::GetVelocity(). Addresses problem report #741.

tracking                                         tracking-V07-00-01
--------
- Changed Trajectory classes to make use of G4AttCheck.
- Removed redundant declaration of SetNavigator() method.
  Addresses problem report #742.

examples                                         examples-V07-00-04
--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- Changed VisManagers in all examples making use of visualization to now
  adopt G4VisExecutive.
- novice
  o N03 (exampleN03-V07-00-01)
    + Fixed compilation error introduced with migration to G4VisExecutive.
  o N06 (exampleN06-V07-00-01)
    + Use SetProcessOrdering() for the decay process.
