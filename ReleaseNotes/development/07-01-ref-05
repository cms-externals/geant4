geometry/divisions                               geomdiv-V07-01-01
------------------
- Protected case of generic construct for G4Polyhedra and G4Polycone
  currently NOT supported for divisions.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V07-01-08
------------------------
- G4Tet:
  o Added implementation for GetPolyhedron() and GetCubicVolume().
  o Corrected order of specifying vertices in CreatePolyhedron().
- G4Ellipsoid: replaced case of call to hypot(x,y) with std::sqrt(x*x+y*y)
  for porting to ISO standard.

  o Protected case of generic construct for visualization.

    of constructor used.

global                                           global-V07-01-04
------
- Revised G4strstreambuf for migration to <sstream> from deprecated
  <strstream>
- Support for CLHEP-2.0.X series:
  o Introduced explicit usage of 'CLHEP::' and 'HepGeom::' namespaces for

- G4Types.hh:
  o Removed '#undef __DEPRECATED' statement in G4Types.hh for strstream
    deprecation by the gcc compiler. Will cause compilation warnings on gcc
    compiler for code still using strstream.

    definition of fake default constructors for usage of direct object
    persistency.
- version.hh: modified for the release 8.0.
