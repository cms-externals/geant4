			===================

geant4-00-ref-06 is geant4-00-ref-05 plus:

config-01-00-04: For CLHEP version 1.4: CLHEP_BASE_DIR has been
    temporarly moved to
    /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/dev/CLHEP/$G4SYSTEM/new.  From Gabriele: By
    using "config-01-00-04" you'll compile your code against the new
    CLHEP version 1.4 now installed at CERN. It requires a complete
    re-compilation of the G4 code.  In this version CLHEP_BASE_DIR has
    been temporarly moved to
    /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/dev/CLHEP/$G4SYSTEM/new it will be moved
    back to "pro" (where the "pro" link will be updated) as soon as
    your tests will be completed.  Note that for DEC-cxx I installed a
    customized version of the CLHEP library where I explicitly
    disabled the ISO-ANSI features which are activated by default (for
    DEC and Win/NT) in the CLHEP installation setup.

persistency-01-00-01: Removed overlapping definition of HepRefVArray
    for G4PVPhysicalVolume in G4PGeometryObjectMap.cc, fixed a typo in
    G4PersistentGeomMan.cc.

procman-01-00-03: Removes procman-emutils dependency.

em-01-00-04: Removes procman-emutils dependency and fixes bug in
    integral approach.

source-gmk-01-00-02: source/GNUmakefile: Always remake library map.

procman-01-00-03a: two new methods of
    G4ProcessManager::GetProcessActivation.

em-01-00-04a: Fix for problem with G4PhysicsLogVector in integral
    approach.

global-01-00-00: Code Wizard cleanup in Units, prototype STL Interface
    (details below).

geometry-01-00-03: Bug fixes and fixes for STL Interface.
