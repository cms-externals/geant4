                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Added possibility to define a tolerance for reporting overlaps; added
    new argument to signature: by default tolerance is set to zero.
  o Adopt G4SafetyHelper via G4TransportationManager for all queries
    from EM processes to geometry on estimation of next step.
  o Completed implementation of hadronic whiteboard error reporting for
    all hadronic models.
  o OpenGL: implemented picking for OGLSX and OGLIX.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------


Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

digits_hits                                      digits_hits-V08-02-00
-----------
- Fixed way of counting outward steps in flux scorers.

geometry/management                              geommng-V08-02-02
-------------------
- Added 'get' methods to stores for retrivial of volumes/solid by name.
- Modified signature of G4VPhysicalVolume::CheckOverlaps() to introduce
  ability of handling tolerances for overlaps.

geometry/navigation                              geomnav-V08-02-02
-------------------
- G4Navigator: new method CheckNextStep() which makes a trial step, without
  changing the state of the navigator. It is a variant of ComputeStep(),
  whose signature it shares.
- G4SafetyHelper can now be accessed via G4TransportationManager. Depending
  on type of navigation (single world or multiple navigation) it uses mass
  navigator or G4PathFinder. All queries from EM processes to geometry are
  made to G4SafetyHelper.
- G4TransportationManager: added G4SafetyHelper.
- G4PathFinder: added initialisation of G4SafetyHelper.

geometry/volumes                                 geomvol-V08-02-02
----------------
- More extensions to the CheckOverlaps() algorithm:
  o Added possibility to define a tolerance for reporting overlaps; added
    new argument to signature, by default tolerance is set to zero.
  o Optimised implementation for detecting daughter volumes which are
    totally overlapping.
  o Added check on current volume to optimise and correctly handle the
    case of explicit call of the method when geometry is constructed.

physics_lists                                    phys-lists-V08-02-08
-------------

processes/electromagnetic/muons                  emmuons-V08-02-01
-------------------------------
- G4MuPairProductionModel: added protection against zero or negative partial
  cross section inside SelectRandomAtom() method.
  Fixes problem reported when runnning tutorial example A01.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V08-02-14
----------------------------------
- G4MultipleScattering:
  o Use by default skin=0, according to current interface to G4SafetyHelper
    which does not yet allow provision of valid steps in the case of magnetic
    field activated.
- G4UrbanMscModel:
  o Stepping near to boundaries has been changed back in order to have small
    steps with single scattering before+after boundary for skin > 1.
  o Use unique calls to G4SafetyHelper; cleaned up logic in method
    ComputeTruePathLengthLimit().
- G4UniversalFluctuation:
  o Correction to algorithm in order to provide for better width.
    Width of the energy loss distribution now agrees rather well with data.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V08-02-08
-------------------------------
- G4VEnegyLossProcess:
  o Adopt unique calls to G4SafetyHelper, with initialisation happening
    inside BuildPhysicsTable().
- G4VEmProcess: removed double call to Clear() method.
