                       ===================

Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last reference
tag are:
    - fixes and new developments in low-energy electromagnetic
      processes.
    - fix in memory management for Boolean solids.
    - fix in tracking when PiMinusAbsorptionAtRest and Decay
      processes are deactivated.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:


electromagnetic processes (low-energy)
--------------------------------------
- Bug fix on electron energy loss fluctuations.
- Some minor cosmetics in hadron classes, no new features. 
- New features on antiproton ionisation, extending the model for
  application to generic materials. 
- Const cast in G4hLowEnergyIonisation (const G4Material* into G4Material*) 
  This modification was required to avoid compilation errors on DEC; 
  it is meant to be temporary. 
- Fix in G4hICRU49He::StoppingPower - a1 changed into e1
  to remove compilation problems on DEC.
- Fix in G4hLowEnergyLoss, eliminated two protected variables 
  G4Proton* theProton and G4AntiProton* theAntiProton 
  to resolve compilation problems on DEC.
- Modifications in hadron classes (renaming of classes).

geometry
--------
- Boolean solids, management:
  o G4SubtractionSolid.cc: relaxed behavior in SurfaceNormal(p), 
    where it is now allowed for a point to be inside the solid. 
    A message is thrown to cerr instead of a G4Exception. 
  o Fixed bug in destructor of G4SolidStore. Memory corruption at
    application exit was occuring when Boolean solids were involved.
- BREPS solids:
  General reorganisation and code cleanup. No functional changes:
  o Created .icc files and moved inline methods implementation. 
  o Added comments to headers for Software Reference Manual. 
  o Fixes for virtual destructors, inline virtual functions and
    operators, const methods and arguments. 
- specific solids:
  o Organised comments to headers for Software Reference Manual.

tracking
--------
- Fix for report #137, added protection when PiMinusAbsorptionAtRest
  and Decay processes are deactivated.
