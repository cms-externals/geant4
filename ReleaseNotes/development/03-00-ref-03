                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included since the last reference
tag are:
    - Fixes in G4Tubs::CalculateExtent() and G4Tubs::Inside(p) in
      computation of pPhi for points at phi = 0.
    - Introduced new helper class G4AssemblyVolume: allows combining
      volumes together in arbitrary way in the 3D space.
    - Fixes in G4StepPoint::GetVelocity() to return correct value
      in case of optical-photons.
    - Full migration to STL vectors for categories: run, event,
      digits+hits, intercoms, readout, tracking.
    - Added pre-assignedDecayTime to G4DynamicParticle.
