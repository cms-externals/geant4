        	          ===================

It is geant4-00-01-ref-00 (which is geant4-00-01 plus some tests
directories) plus:

track-01-00-07:         G4MARS5GeVMechanism.cc: == -> =.
config-V00-01-00:       Added EXTRA_LINK_DEPENDENCIES to binmake.gmk.
STLInterface-V00-01-00: Implementation of RWCString::hash(const RWCString&)
                          (needed for g3tog4).
examples-V00-01-00:     - Eliminated references to G4Ray in ExN02VisManager.cc
                            and N03. 
                        - Updated exampleN04.EMtest.out and exampleN04.out to
                            correspond to SUN version of geant4-00-01.
run-V00-01-00:          The status of the random number engine can be stored in
                          separate files*.
materials-V00-01-00:    - new Material constructors with chemical formula for
                            low energy physics. 
                        - few cleanup between G4cout and G4cerr**.
examples-V00-01-01:     Updated exampleN02.out for geant4-00-01-ref-01.

-----------------------------------------------
* Details of new run commands:

Command /run/storeRandomNumberStatus
Guidance :
Store the status of the random number engine to a file.
See CLHEP manual for detail.
Frequency : 0 - not stored
            1 - begining of each run
           -1 - begining of each run (file overwritten)
            2 - begining of each event before generating primaries
           -2 - begining of each event before generating primaries
	        (file overwritten)
Stored status can be restored by 
  /run/restoreRandomNumberStatus command.
In case Frequency is negative, a output file (file name RandEngine.stat)
  is overwitten every time.
In case Frequency is 1, file names are RandEngineRxxx.stat,
  where xxx is the run number.
In case Frequency is 2, file names are RandEngineRxxxEyyy.stat,
  where xxx is the run number and yyy is the event number.

Command /run/restoreRandomNumberStatus
Guidance :
Restore the status of the random number engine from a file.
See CLHEP manual for detail.
The engine status must be stored beforehand.

--------------------------------------------
** A warning has moved from G4cout to G4cerr, seen in exampleN02 and test08:

---warning from G4Material--
 The state conditions of the gas: Vacuum are not consistent.
 density  = 1e-17 mg/cm3	 pressure = 1 atmosphere
 temperature = 273.15 kelvin
 rho*(T/P) would be of the order of: 12.1865 (mg/cm3)*(kelvin/atmosphere).
 The energy loss calculation maybe be affected

param-V00-01-00

New tag param-V00-01-00 fix a bug in G4FastStep::CheckIt()
with was issueing a false warning in a very special case.
