                       ===================

Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last release are:
    - fix for problem of energu non-conservation observed in
      hadronic high-energies physics processes.
    - modified G4UImanager to become state-dependent, in order to
      correctly handle new "abort" state when a G4Exception is
      thrown.
    - improvements to G4UIterminal and sessions.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the full list of changes is the following:


low-energy electromagnetic processes
------------------------------------
- Bug fix to G4hLowEnergyIonisation, relevant for particles 
  with absolute charge value greater than 1.

hadronic processes
------------------
- Fixed bug for reported energy non-conservation problem in the
  high-energy model.

event
-----
- Added some new Set methods to G4PrimaryVertex and
  G4PrimaryParticle classes. 

interfaces
----------
- Modified G4UIterminal, G4VUIshell, G4UIcsh and G4UItcsh to display
  the break status as a prompt characters.

run, global, intercoms
----------------------
- Moved G4VStateDependent and G4StateManager classes into
  global/management from intercoms. 
- Added "Abort" state is added G4ApplicationState. 
- Modified G4Exception to change Geant4 status to "Abort". 
- Bug fix of "double deleting" in the destructor of G4StateManager.
- Modified G4RunManager and G4RunMessenger: eliminated 
  G4StateManager::Pause().
- Made G4UImanager state dependent.

g3tog4 tool
-----------
o Moved tests clGeometry and cltog4 from source/g3tog4/test to
  examples/extended/g3tog4. Default build mechanism is now used.
o Fixed bug to g3tog4/GNUmakefile for allowing building of shared
  libraries. Adapted to work with granular libraries mechanism.
o Bug-fix in destructor for G3RotTable.
o Added handling of ELTU (Elliptical Tube) solid.
