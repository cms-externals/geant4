                       ===================

Major development/fixes included since the last development tag are:

 o Added new factory function ManagerInstance() in G4Analysis, which allows
   to create the analysis manager of the type selected via a string argument.
 o Introducing G4ScoringRealWorld, allowing to define command-based scorers
   to a logical volume in the mass world.
 o In G4PairProductionRelModel and G4GammaConversion, the high energy model
   for e-/e+ pair production has been extended down to threshold (2mc^2) such
   that it gives results (both cross-section and final state) identical to
   those produced by the low energy model.
 o In G4HadronNucleonXsc, added new interface to G4ComponentGGHadronNucleonXsc
   including s-,c-,b- particles.
 o Changed logic in G4UnstableFragmentBreakUp, to allow for decay of an exotic
   fragment and never release it.
 o Improvements to FTF model for nucleus-nucleus interactions (with
    negligible effects for hadron-nucleus) and extended range of excited
    hadron masses in G4DiffractiveExcitation, starting from ground-state values.

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

-----
- Set OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE to LEGACY, to prevent warning on CMake >= 3.10,
  and keeping existing behaviour.
- Only scope location of test executable when using a generator that supports
  multi-config; allows tests to be run with Ninja Generator as "ninja test".

------
- Fixed compilation warning on gcc-9.2 for liblist.c.

--------
- Added new factory function ManagerInstance() in G4Analysis, which allows
  to create the analysis manager of the type selected via a string argument.

  specific namespace.
- Added methods for setting ntuple merge mode in G4VAnalysisManager with a
  default implementation (issuing a warning if merging is not available).

----------
- Fixed square backets around optional parameters.
  Addressing problem report #2132.

physics_lists/constructors/electromagnetic       phys-ctor-em-V10-05-16
------------------------------------------
- G4EmLivermorePhysics, G4EmLowEPPhysics, G4EmStandardPhysics_option4:
  use SetEmModel(..) instead of AddEmModel(..) for gamma conversion.
  Updated settings of the gamma conversion process to provide the original
  model combinations when the low energy G4BetheHeitlerModel model was
  replaced by the G4BetheHeitler5DModel. 
- G4OpticalPhysics: set boundary process to last.
  Addressing problem report #2113.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V10-05-18
----------------------------------
- G4PairProductionRelModel, G4GammaConversion: the high energy model for e-/e+
  pair production has been extended down to threshold (2mc^2) such that it
  gives results (both cross-section and final state) identical to those
  produced by the low energy (G4BetheHeitlerModel). Since this new version of
  the high energy model can describe e-/e+ pair production from threshold up
  to PeV (LPM effects are included) the G4BetheHeitlerModel is now removed from
  the G4GammaConversion process.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V10-05-17
-------------------------------
- G4EmParameters: disable "General Process" for gamma by default.

  o G4HadronNucleonXsc: new interface to G4ComponentGGHadronNucleonXsc
    including s-,c-,b-, particles.

    G4BGGPionElasticXS: clean-up low-energy.
  o G4UPiNuclearCrossSection: below 20 MeV cross-section is now const, BGGPion
    cross-section implementing the low-energy part.
- management (hadr-man-V10-05-05)
  o G4HadronicProcess: fixed defects reported by Coverity.
- models/de_excitation (hadr-deex-V10-05-14)
  o G4ExcitationHandler removed second photon evaporation loop, as all gamma
    decays are already happening in the first loop. Use more C++11 constructs.
    Added limit on number of warnings on high excitation of input fragment.
    Fixed defects reported by Coverity.
  o G4FermiFragmentsPoolVI: implemented new method HasChannels().
  o G4FermiBreakUpVI: use new method HasChannels() inside IsApplicable().
  o G4Evaporation: make coherent use of IsApplicable() from G4FermiBreakUp and
    force simplified decay of exotic fragments with G4UnstableFragmentBreakUp.
  o G4UnstableFragmentBreakUp: changed logic, allowing decay of an exotic
    fragment (fragment is not known in gamma level DB) and never release it.
- models/parton_string/diffraction (hadr-string-diff-V10-05-04)
  o Improvements to FTF model for nucleus-nucleus interactions (with
    negligible effects for hadron-nucleus).
  o G4DiffractiveExcitation: extended range of excited hadron masses,
    starting from ground-state values (before it was starting from current
    hadron masses).
  o G4ElasticHNScattering: improvement and simplification of the algorithm
    of elastic scattering (before the masses of resonances were sampled,
    now it is not needed any longer).
  o G4FTFModel: improvement of the algorithm of string creation.       
  o Deleted G4DiffractiveHHScatterer, no longer used.
