hadrons-V00-01-00

This is a new tag for particles/hadrons.
From this tag, class name and method name using 'Barion' have been changed to
use 'Baryon'.
For example, G4Barion is renamed to G4Baryon, and 'ConstructAllBarion' of
PhysicsList is renamed to 'ConstructAllBaryon' 

This change does not imply changes in algorithm but affects examples and test
programs. In addition, you may need to change your 'category tests'.

Please use following tags in your development and testing.   

 hadrons-V00-01-00
 shortlived-V00-01-00
 examples-V00-01-04
 tests-V00-01-00
