                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Introduced new G4Exception scheme based on severity level.
  o Re-implemented EventAborted() method to ensure its correct behavior
    during stepping.
  o Bug fixes in low-energy processes for calculation of restricted energy
    loss of electrons, and memory leak in G4AtomicTransition.
  o Bug fix in G4MultipleScattering for lateral displacement.
  o Removed obsolete constructors with chemical formula in G4Material.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                  config-V04-01-01
------
- binmake.gmk: added include path to persistency/run/include which was 
  missing. Removed unnecessary processes/general/include. 
- liblist.c: added protection and warning for file/directory not found 
  in parsedir. Also small cosmetic improvements. 

event                                   event-V04-01-02
-----
- G4Event: introduced 'EventAborted' flag.
- Change the default value of charge for G4PrimaryParticle.

geometry/volumes                        geomvol-V04-01-04
----------------
- Formatting cleanup in source implementation files.
  No functional changes.

global                                  global-V04-01-01
------
- Introduced new G4Exception scheme based on severity level.
  o Added : G4ExceptionSeverity.hh
  o Modified : G4VStateDependent[.hh.cc], G4Exception.cc,
               G4StateManager.hh and globals.hh

materials				materials-V04-01-00
---------
- G4Material: removed constructors with chemical formula.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy     emlowen-V04-01-03
-----------------------------------
- Fix in calculation of restricted energy loss of e-.
- Fixed memory leak problem in G4AtomicTransition.

processes/electromagnetic/standard	stand-V04-01-00
----------------------------------
- GammaConversionToMuons: corrected syntax of OR conditions in DoIt().

processes/electromagnetic/utils		utils-V04-01-01
-------------------------------
- G4VEnergyLoss: fix for gaussian fluctuations sampling at very low energy.
- G4MultipleScattering: bug fix in PostStepDoIt() for lateral displacement.

run					run-V04-01-03
---
- G4RunManager, G4RunMessenger:
  o Introduced "soft abortion", to allow event loop to abort after
    processing the current event. G4RunManager sets "eventAbortion"
    flag of G4Event if that particular event is aborted.
  o Introduced AbortEvent() method and corresponding UI command.
- Introduced new G4Exception scheme:
  o Added : G4ExceptionHandler[.hh.cc].
  o Modified : G4RunManager[.hh.cc].
- G4RunManager: introduced ResetNavigator() method needed in cases
  where a geometry has been modified between runs in order to properly
  re-initialize navigator's state.

tracking				tracking-V04-01-01
--------
- G4TrackingManager.hh, G4TrackingManager.cc
  o Re-implemented EventAborted() method to ensure this command
    works properly during stepping phase.
  o Set fpTrajectory pointer to zero when the trajectory is deleted.

examples
--------
- extended/electromagnetic/TesEm5:
  o Fixed RunAction: BookHisto() only at first run.
- extended/gdml:
  o Fixed warnings on SUN and SUN linker problem.
