                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Added new specific shapes G4EllipticalCone and G4Tet.
  o Added utility method to CSG solids and most specific solids to
    return a random point on the surface.
  o Major cleanup for graphics_reps classes (removed redundant intermediate
    class G4VVisPrim).
  o Introduced smooth shading in OpenGL driver. Introduced RayTracerX.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V07-01-01
------
- Synchronized CXXFLAGS warning options of WIN32-g++ with Linux-g++.

geometry/management                              geommng-V07-01-00
-------------------
- Added virtual method GetPointOnSurface() to G4VSolid to be implemented in
  the concrete solids classed for returning a random-point uniformly
  distributed on the surface.

geometry/solids/BREPS                            breps-V07-01-00
---------------------
- Fixed problem of double-deletion in G4BREPSolidPolyhedra and
  G4BREPSolidPCone destructors.

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V07-01-01
-------------------
- Added GetPointOnSurface() to all solids. The method returns a random
  point according to a quasi-uniform distribution along the surface.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V07-01-04
------------------------
- Introduced new solid G4EllipticalCone, a full cone with elliptical base
  that can be cut in Z. Added also unit test.
- Introduced new solid G4Tet implementing a tetrahedra, contribution of
  M.H.Mendenhall and R.A.Weller.
- Added GetPointOnSurface() for all solids except twisted ones.
  The method returns a random point according to a quasi-uniform
  distribution along the surface.

geometry/solids/test                             geom-solids-tests-V07-01-01
--------------------
- Added new tests testPointOnSurface and testSolidComparisons.

graphics_reps                                    greps-V07-01-02
-------------
- Added Polyhedron description for new G4EllipticalCone shape.
- Source code cleanup:
  o removed redundant intermediate class, G4VVisPrim;
  o removed redundant virtual assignments and similar oddities.

processes/electromagnetic/highenergy             emhighenergy-V07-01-01
------------------------------------
- Minor cleanup: removed inline constructors and destructors.

processes/electromagnetic/xrays                  xrays-V07-01-00
-------------------------------
- Added G4ProcessType identifier to all processes constructors.

processes/optical                                op-V07-01-00
-----------------
- Added G4ProcessType identifier to all processes constructors.

visualization                                    vis-V07-01-00
-------------
- OpenGL: introduced smooth shading. Also window size hints for Xm.
- OpenInventor (openinventor-V07-01-01):
  o changed Geant4_SoPolyhedron to construct from G4Polyhedron.
    Functionality unchanged.
  o Fixed compilation errors and warnings on gcc-4.0.X.
- Raytracer: introduced RayTracerX.
- HepRep (vis-HepRep-V07-01-00): fix for 'DrawAs' value which was wrong
  for solids using Geant4 primitives.
- management: protected new viewer pointer.
- Revision of unit tests and removed obsolete top-level README files.

--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- extended
  o medical/GammaTherapy (gtherapy-V07-01-00)
    + Added vis.mac and histogram type (aida, root, hbook).
    + Use standard angular distribution for low-energy PhotoElectric.

tests                                            tests-V07-01-02
-----
- Updated reference outputs.
- Updated GNUmakefile (tests-gmk-V07-01-00) to include TestEm11,12
  and test19,29.
