                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included since the last reference
tag are:

    and Annih standard electromagnetic processes.
  o First step of design iteration in fluorescence for low-energy
    electromagnetic processes.
  o Improved user commands in G4GeneralParticleSource.
  o Added a new feature for the user to increase the number of
    waiting stacks.
  o Re-engineered G4UI variables.
  o Re-implemented verbosity control in visualization.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                          config-V03-02-04
------
- Re-engineered G4UI variables.
- Introduced environment variable G4UI_NONE that, if set, no UI
  sessions nor any UI libraries are built.
  (This would only happen in a pure batch job or, perhaps, in a user
  framework having its own UI system.)
- Removed the need to specify environment variables for UI sessions
  which do not need external packages or libraries, namely :
    G4UI_BUILD_GAG_SESSION, G4UI_BUILD_TERMINAL_SESSION
  with associated G4UI_USE environment variables:
    G4UI_USE_GAG, G4UI_USE_TCSH, G4UI_USE_TERMINAL
  The above environment variables become redundant and are ignored.
- As before, environment variables for other sessions still need
  positive setting of their G4UI_BUILD and G4UI_USE environment
  variables. In this category are:
    G4UI_BUILD_WIN32_SESSION, G4UI_BUILD_WO_SESSION,
    G4UI_BUILD_XAW_SESSION, G4UI_BUILD_XM_SESSION
  with associated G4UI_USE environment variables:
    G4UI_USE_WIN32, G4UI_USE_WO, G4UI_USE_XAW, G4UI_USE_XM
- Note: The user must still instantiate and SessionStart only *one*
  session, but if it is to be one in the category needing external
  packages or libraries, the corresponding G4UI_USE must be set to
  trigger inclusion of libraries.  Otherwise the user needs not set any
  environment variables.

event                           event-V03-02-05
-----
- G4PrimaryParticle now stores the proper trackID.
- Added a new feature for the user to increase the number of waiting
  stacks.
- In G4GeneralParticleSource (GPS):
  Most commands under G4ParticleGun class are now available.
  Implemented co-ordinates rotation for angular distribution.
  User defined co-ordinates was an option available to user in the
  messenger but not implemented internally in the older version gps.
  Source angular distribution coupled with positional distribution can
  lead to rather strange combinations. To avoid this I used a simple
  scheme in this implementation:
  o For cos-law angular distribution the default maxtheta is set to
    pi/2. instead of pi. The user can of course re-set this to any
    number between 0 - pi.
  o Added user defined histogram re-set method. After re-set user can
    redefine all the histograms. To use: /gps/resethist  'histname'
  o Bug fixed in generating theta, and in calculating the weight.
  o Added further guidance in the messenger for the definition of
    pre-defined energy distributions.
- Bug fix in G4EventManager in case G4_STORETRAJECTORY is off. 
  Fixes problem report #289.

geometry/solids/Boolean         geom-solids-bool-V03-02-00
-----------------------
- Introduced G4BOOLDEBUG flag and relaxed G4Exception calls with
  warnings to G4cerr for rare occurences of anomalous conditions.

geometry/solids/BREPS           breps-V03-02-03
---------------------
- G4BREPSolidPolyhedra.cc: fixed situation when phi1 = 0 dphi1 = 2*pi
  and all RMINs = 0.0. In this case the inner planes are not created.
  More than 2 z-planes and inner planes are not created whenever two
  consecutive RMINs are = 0.0.
  Fixes problem report #266.

geometry/solids/CSG             geom-solids-csg-V03-02-00

  are controlled by the verbosity in a simple graded message scheme:
    enum Verbosity {
      quiet,         // Nothing is printed.
      startup,       // Startup and endup messages are printed...
      errors,        // ...and errors...
      warnings,      // ...and warnings...
      confirmations, // ...and confirming messages...
      parameters,    // ...and parameters of scenes and views...
      all            // ...and everything available.
