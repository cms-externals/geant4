                       ===================

Some of the fixes included since the last reference tag are:
    - Fixes in e/hEnergyLoss standard EM processes: AlongStepDoIt()
      and cut in range.
    - Fix in parametrisation of energy loss in eBrem EM process.
    - Bug fix in materials/G4IonisParamMat affecting density
      correction parameters in the energy loss (dE/dx) computation.
    - Fixes in G4Tubs::Inside(p) concerning phi-section algorithm.
    - Fixes in DistanceToOut(p,v,...) for G4UnionSolid and G4Hype.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

global 			global-V03-00-01
------
- First step of migration to STL vectors: 
  migrated G4PhysicsVector class and related sub-classes. 
- Fix to G4Allocator destructor: bug report #181.

geometry/solids/CSG	geom-solids-csg-V03-00-00
-------------------
- G4Tubs.cc: corrections in phi-section algorithm of Inside(p). 
- Fixed condition from (pPhi<0) to (pPhi<-0.5*kAngleTolerance) 
  in G4Tubs::Inside(p). Fixes problem report #198.

geometry/solids/specific	geom-solids-specific-V03-00-00
------------------------
- Fix in G4Hype::DistanceToOut(p,v,...):
  added protection against zero v.z.

geometry/solids/Boolean		geom-solid-bool-V03-00-01
-----------------------
- Fix in G4UnionSolid::DistanceToOut(p,v,...) for assignment of
  argument *n to happen only if calcNorm is false. 
- Minor fix to labels in G4Exception calls.
  Fixes problem report #200. 
- Updated unit tests testG4IntersectionSolid.cc, 
  testG4SubtractionSolid.cc and testG4UnionSolid.cc. 

materials			materials-V03-00-01
---------
- Bug fixed in G4IonisParamMat.cc : E100eV instead of E100keV
  This bug affected the values of the density correction parameters
  in the energy loss (dE/dx) computation: ~3-5 % error in dE/dx in
  the energy range 1 MeV - 50 MeV !

processes/electromagnetic/standard		stand-V03-00-01
----------------------------------
- Small corrections in e/hEnergyLoss to ensure consistency between
  cut in range and step limitation due to energy loss (finalRange
  data member <-> cut in range)
- Change in energy loss computation in eBrems process.
  Parametrisation of energy loss due to soft brems has been corrected
  for big cut values.
- Bug-fix in e/hEnergyLoss processes for AlongStepDoIt().
  Do not use PostStep information in AlongStepDoIt() when generating
  sub-cutoff delta rays.

processes/electromagnetic/muons			muons-V03-00-00 
-------------------------------
- Small corrections in MuEnergyLoss process.

processes/electromagnetic/utils			utils-V03-00-00 
-------------------------------
- Bug fixed in MultipleScattering: there was an error in computation
  of the transport cross section, the cross section was too small for
  low energy (below few MeV for electrons).

processes/optical				op-V03-00-03
-----------------
- Modified G4OpRayleigh to allow for Rayleigh scattering length to
  be defined for arbitrary material through the use of 
  G4MaterialPropertyTable. This deals with bug report #199.
