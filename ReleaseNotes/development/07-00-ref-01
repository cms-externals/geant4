- Fixed reset of histogram energy limits in G4SPSEneDistribution.
- Restored the inheritance to G4VPrimaryGenerator for the
  G4GeneralParticleSource class.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V07-00-00  (*)
------------------------
- Use new polynom approximations based on new solver based on
  Jenkins-Traub algorithm, for twisted-box and twisted-trap.
- Fixed bug in the usage of 'fmod' and adopt special treatment for
  'parallel' events in G4TwistedBoxSide and G4TwistedTrapSide.

global                                           global-V07-00-00	  (*)
------
- Added polynom-solver class G4JTPolynomialSolver implementing the
  Jenkins-Traub algorithm for real polynomial root finding. To be used
  by the twisted-trap shape for precise computation of intersections.

intercoms                                        intercoms-V07-00-00
---------
- Interim tag for migration from AddThis() to AddSolid() and AddCompound().
- G4VGraphicsScene: introduced new names.
  Old methods call new methods as interim solution.
- G4VVisManager::Draw(): removed default argument.

interfaces                                       interfaces-V07-00-00	  (*)
----------
- Minor fix in GNUmakefiles to remove unnecessary definition of G4TMPDIR.

parameterisations/gflash                         gflash-V07-00-01	  (*)
------------------------
- Fix in GFlashHitMaker for treatment of detector sensitivity.

particles                                        particles-V07-00-00	  (*)
---------
- Fix in G4UnknownParticle to make it non-static, in order to avoid
  unnecessary linking without its definition in the physics list.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               stand-V07-00-01	  (*)
----------------------------------
- Fix in UniversalFluctuation: setting proper constants for probLim 
  and minimum energy-loss, to improve simulation of energy loss in
        thin absorbers.
- Fix in MultipleScattering for function SetSamplez().
- Add extra protection to G4PAIModel to fix cases of NaN observed
  in production for ALICE. 

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  utils-V07-00-00	  (*)
-------------------------------
- Bug fix to avoid crash in the inactivation of e- ionisation.
- Added protection on the value of effective charge to ensure energy
  loss for low energy ions.
- Fixing initialisation problem for ion beam observed in CMS.

processes/hadronic/models/chiral.../body         ghad-chips-body-V07-00-04 (*)
----------------------------------------
- Fixed problem of inconsistency between masses of hadrons and nuclear
  fragments and masses defined in Geant4. Conversion of the CHIPS hadrons
  to Geant4  secondaries uses now a kinetic energy of the particle, so
  Geant4 automatically puts particles on the mass shell.
- Complete usage of the existing nuclear mass approximation of Geant4
  [including M(Z,N)_G4>m_p*Z+m_n*N].
- Improvement in G4QEnvironmemt in the usage of FinalStateInteraction
  A few cases of the secondary particles below mass shell have been
  corrected. 

processes/management                             procman-V07-00-00	  (*)
--------------------
- Fix in G4ProcessManager to correct ordering of processes.

run                                              run-V07-00-00		  (*)
---
- Fix in G4RunManager and G4RunManagerKernel to correctly reset static
  pointers in the case when RunManager is deleted.
- Updated date to run-manager.

visualization                                    vis-V07-00-03
-------------
- Migration from AddThis() to AddSolid() and AddCompound():
  o AddSolid: methods for adding solids to the scene handler.
  o AddCompound: methods for adding "compound" objects to the scene
    handler.  These methods may either (a) invoke "user code" through
    G4VVisManager or (b) invoke AddPrimitives() or (c) use
    graphics-system-specific code or (d) any combination of the above.
- Introduced G4VisExecutive. MyVisManager deprecated.
- G4VisManager:: removed optional argument from Draw() methods for hit
  and trajectory.
- Added fpCurrentMaterial to G4VSceneHandler and relevant derived
  classes and models for work with G4PhysicalVolumeModel via
  EstablishSpecials.  So now, the material is also available (in addition
  to current depth, logical and physical volum) during drawing of geometry
  items.
- Changed ASCIITree to use G4VSolid::GetCubicVolume() and
  G4LogicalVolume::GetMass().
- Changed G4PhysicalVolumeMassScene to use G4VSolid::GetCubicVolume().
- Improved guidance for /vis/viewer/set/hiddenMarker.
- G4VisCommandsViewerSet: made Up and Viewpoint vectors unit for safety.
- HepRep (vis-HepRep-V07-00-00):					  (*)
  o Minor fix for compilation problem on the obsolete gcc-2.95.2.

physics_lists/hadronic                           ghad-lists-V07-00-01	  (*)
----------------------
- Fixed compilation problems on gcc-3.4.X compiler series:
  Added explicit 'typename' keywords to template class declarations.
  Use 'this' pointer to access data-members of base class for
  unqualified names in physics-lists inline definitions.

examples                                         examples-V07-00-00	  (*)
--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- extended
  o electromagnetic/TestEm1 (testem1-V07-00-00)
    + HistoManager: added protection for the creation of the analysis
      factory. File extension is fileType.
    + HistoMessenger: new command 'setFileOption'.
  o electromagnetic/TestEm3 (testem3-V07-00-03)
    + Fix in SteppingAction to correct the energy flow.
    + Added new macros linac.mac and geant3/linac.dat.
- novice
  o N02 (exampleN02-V07-00-00)
    + PhysicsList: added usage of G4StepLimiter (as commented line).
  o N03 (exampleN03-V07-00-00)
    + Fix in SteppingAction: sum stepLength of charged particle
      even if edep=0.
