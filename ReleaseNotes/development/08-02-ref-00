                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Changed QGSC default physics list to follow 8.1 modeling.
  o Important bug fix in CHIPS model in G4QIsotope for observed cases
    of negative abundance.
  o Allow build of DLL libraries on Windows for physics lists.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------


Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

physics_lists                                    phys-lists-V08-01-13
-------------
- Added QGSC_EFLOW, using new energy flow method for CHIPS; consequently,
  HadronPhysicsQGSC_EFLOW and builders G4QGSCEflow{Proton,Neutron,PiK}Builder
  added as well.
- Changed QGSC to use G4QStringChipsParticleLevelInterface via the builders
  G4QGS{Proton,Neutron,PiK}Builder; this emulates 8.1 modeling.
- GNUmakefile: added definition of GLOBLIBS with correct library
  dependencies to allow for generation of DLLs on Windows.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V08-01-16
----------------------------------
- G4UrbanMscModel: fix in ComputeTruePathLengthLimit(); setting
  stepmin=1.e-6*mm.

processes/hadronic
------------------
- models/chiral_inv_phase_space/body (hadr-chips-body-V08-01-08)
  o Important bug fix in G4QIsotope: fixed double subtraction of abundance
    in 'MeanCrossSection' calculation, which caused negative abundance...
  o Fixed some cases of generation of NaN in computation of cos(theta).
- models/chiral_inv_phase_space/interface (hadr-chips-inter-V08-01-18)
  o Low energy neutrons are added to G4QElastic (+ minor bugs fixes).
  o Global multi-projectile tag fix for cross-sections.
  o Added G4QStringChipsParticleLevelInterface, 8.1 version of the
    G4StringChipsParticleLevelInterface. To be used for "cascade" in the QGSC
    physics list. G4StringChipsParticleLevelInterface to be used in the new
    QGSC2 physics lists.
  o Minor corrections in the low energy neutron elastic (did not cover all
    stable isotopes and some typos).
  o Fixed some cases of generation of NaN in computation of cos(theta).
- stopping (hadr-stopping-V08-01-01)
  o Corrected inconsistent use of 'targetA'; for effective 'targetA'
    transforming to integer gives values different by 1.
- util (hadr-util-V08-01-01)
  o Added protection in variables 'local_npnb' and 'local_ndta' from division
    by zero in G4ReactionDynamics::AddBlackTrackParticles().

processes/GNUmakefile                            processes-gmk-V08-01-02
---------------------
- Added missing extension to 'digits_hits' library name for GLOBLIBS
  definition. Required to allow for build of DLLs on Windows. 

source/GNUmakefile                               source-gmk-V08-01-04
------------------
- Forced creation of 'liblist' application also when installing global
  libraries. Required to address problem report #897.
- Improved printout.

run                                              run-V08-01-06
---
- Fixed memory leak at initialisation in G4MatScanMessenger.
- Modified CheckRegions() method not to use inefficient and obsolete
  SetWorld() method in G4RegionStore. Set world volumes to regions directly
  and more efficiently by retrieving the list of worlds from
  G4TransportationManager.

visualization/management                         visman-V08-01-16
-------------
- Commented command "vis/scene/add/eventID" forcing event ID to scene
  in G4VisCommandsCompound implementation.

examples                                         examples-V08-02-00
--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- extended/electromagnetic/TestEm0 (testem0-V08-01-02)
  o Corrected printout in BeginOfRun().
- extended/electromagnetic/TestEm7 (testem7-V08-01-03)
  o Fix in Livermore physics list constructor.
  o Fixed use of elastic constructor.
- extended/gdml (exgdml-V08-01-00)
  o Set schema location to LCG release area in test.gdml.
  o Updated README and GNUmakefile.
- novice/N02 (exampleN02-V08-01-01)
  o Commented out drawing of hits in vis.mac.
- novice/N04 (exampleN04-V08-01-08)
  o Commented out drawing of hits in vis.mac.
  o Removed obsolete printout in GNUmakefile.

tests                                            tests-V08-02-00
-----
- Updated reference outputs.
- test39 (test39-V08-01-03)
  o Zero cross-section projectiles are skipped in main().
