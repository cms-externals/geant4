                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included since the last reference
tag are:

  o Extended G4PropagatorInField to enable the use of different
    field managers for different parts of the detector.
    This first implementation allows a volume that has a field
    manager to override the global one
  o Fixes to G4AuxiliaryNavServices and G4ReplicaNavigation to
    properly handle cases on boundaries.
  o Fixes and extensions of BooleanProcessor to covering unforeseen
    cases in visualization during preselection of faces without
    intersection.
  o Introduced new EM low-energy process for polarised Compton
    scattering.
  o First round of fixes for clearing pedantic warnings detected
    on Linux ANSI setup.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

geometry/magneticfield		field-V03-01-02
----------------------
- Updated G4Mag_SpinEqRhs.hh and G4Mag_SpinEqRhs.cc for correction
  to spin tracking.
- Fixed G4FieldManager constructors to give default values to delta 
  parameters. 

geometry/management             geommng-V03-01-04
-------------------
- Adopt explicit initialisation for 'minExtents' and 'maxExtents' 
  in G4SmartVoxelHeader::BuildNodes(...). 

geometry/solids			geom-solids-csg-V03-01-02
---------------
- Added G4CSGDEBUG preprocessor flag to discriminate for debug
  verbosity specific to CSG solids. Included in G4Exception of
  DistanceToOut() for "point p is outside" in G4Box, G4Cons, G4Tubs.

geometry/volumes		geomvol-V03-01-08
----------------
- G4AuxiliaryNavServices::CheckPointOnSurface(): added additional
  check to resolve endless looping of G4Navigator in case the track
  is passing through a point, edge or surface shared by two solids. 
  Fixes problem report #185. 
- Fixes in G4ReplicaNavigation for bug reports #253 and #254: 
  o in VoxelLocate(...), treated particular case of rotational
    symmetry  with extent over 360 degrees. 
  o in DistanceToOutPhi(...), fix to correctly handle cases where
    the starting point is on boundary of replicas and direction is
    along boundary. 
- Enabled the use of different field managers for different parts
  of the detector. This first implementation allows a volume that
  has a field manager to override the global one. 
  o Note: All field managers currently must refer to fields
          in global coordinates. 
  o New ability: setting of the delta accuracy parameters differently
          in different volumes (even while maintaining the same
          field as the global one).
- Added new parameter to G4PropagatorInField 'fEpsilonMin' which is
  the minimal relative accuracy for MF driving. 

graphics_reps			greps-V03-01-03
-------------
- Now covering unforeseen earlier situation during preselection of
  faces without intersection.
- Fixed pedantic warnings detected on Linux ANSI setup.
- Made GetNumberOfRotationSteps() static and public.
- Migrated to STL vector. Removed references to RW wrappers.
- Added GetSurfaceArea() and GetVolume() to HepPolyhedron. 
- Bug fix in BooleanProcessor to address problem report #153. 

intercoms			intercoms-V03-01-00
---------
- Fixed pedantic warnings detected on Linux ANSI setup.

materials			materials-V03-01-00
---------
- Fixed pedantic warnings detected on Linux ANSI setup.

particles			particles-V03-01-00
---------
- Fixed pedantic warnings detected on Linux ANSI setup.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy	emlowen-V03-01-16
-----------------------------------
- Migration to STL vector. Removed references to RW wrappers.
- Fixed pedantic warnings detected on Linux ANSI setup.
- Added new process for polarised Compton scattering.

processes/electromagnetic/util		utils-V03-01-00
------------------------------
- Fixed pedantic warnings detected on Linux ANSI setup.

processes/hadronic/models/high_energy	had_mod_high-V03-01-03
-------------------------------------
- Updates and fixes.

processes/management			procman-V03-01-00
--------------------
- Fixed pedantic warnings detected on Linux ANSI setup.

tracking			tracking-V03-01-01
--------
- Migration to STL vector. Removed references to RW wrappers.
- Moved G4TrackingMessenger* messenger to the class scope in
  G4TrackingManager.
- Fixed problem of vertex information loss for suspended tracks.
  Fixes problem report #240.

visualization			vis-V03-01-01
-------------
- Migration to STL vector. Removed references to RW wrappers.
- Improvements in /vis/scene/add/volume.
- Added /vis/drawTree.

g3tog4				g3tog4-V03-01-00
------
- Fix in GNUmakefile: G4MAKESHLIB replaced with G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED
  to allow building of shared library according to the new mechanism.
- Fix in G3toG4BuildTree for a case of the placement a volume in
  cloned mothers. G3toG4BuildTree() has been split in two methods
  G3toG4BuildLVTree() and G3toG4BuildPVTree(), the first creating
  logical volumes only, the second performing placements afterwards.

examples
--------
- exampleN05: fix for migration to STL vector of visualization code.

tests			tests-V03-01-02
-----
- Added new test 'test20' testing new low-energy process for
  polarised Compton scattering.
- test17: Updated according to new developments in EM-lowenergy;
  added new reference output and cleared compilation warnings.
