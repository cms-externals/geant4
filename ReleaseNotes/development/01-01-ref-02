geant4-01-01-ref-02 is geant4-01-01-ref-01 plus:

testem6-V01-00-02   - Simulation of ranges and straggling of hadrons/ions.
greps-V01-01-00     - Code Tidy and boolean operations on HepPolyhedron.
config-V01-01-02    - nmake.gmk add geometry/solids/specific;
                    - modified g4step_correct.pl.
g3tog4-V01-01-00    - Modified make files;
                    - added geometry/solids/specific to include paths.
geometry-V01-01-00  - Restructured CSG:
  - Restructured CSG directory:
    o moved all shapes which are non-pure CSG to solids/specific.
      See related History files for more details.
    o moved unit-tests to appropriate test directories.
    o extracted tests "SBT" and "Fred" and placed one level up in
      solids/tests (new directory).
  - Fixes to G4Tubes.cc and G4Hype[.hh.cc].
  - Added new shape in solids/specific: G4EllipticalTube.
  - Organised class description comments for the Software Reference Manual
    in CSG and specific headers. Added CVS headers to files in specific.
vis-V01-01-00       - make files for Restructured CSG.
neu-V01-01-01       - Q-values on Lithium-6, gamma production on Iron56,
                      triton production on B-10.
geometry-V01-01-01  - Changes for visualization.
                    - G4DisplacedSolid: fixed and reversed implementation of
                      GetFrameRotation and GetObjectRotation.
greps-V01-01-01     - Code Tidy to remove HP Compiler warnings.
vis-V01-01-01       - boolean solid visualization with G4Polyhedron objects.
emlowen-V01-01-05   - Improvements.
emlowen-V01-01-07   - Correction to emlowen-V01-01-05 in
                      G4LowEnergyBremsstrahlung.cc.
