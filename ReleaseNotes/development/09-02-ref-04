physics_lists                                    phys-lists-V09-02-15
-------------
- Added MaxEnergy() method in FTF builders.
- Added QGSP_FTFP_BERT based on QGSP_BERT replacing the bridging LEP
  with FTFP, and transitioning from BERT to FTFP between 7 and 9 GeV;
- Added FB68 as variant of FTFP_BERT with transition between 6 and 8 GeV.
- Added two new physics lists QGSC_QGSC and QGSC_CHIPS are added.
  QGSC_QGSC physics list uses the QGS model with the MultiSoft
  interface to CHIPS at all energies, starting from E=0. For neutrons
  it still uses LHEP models for the radioactive capture and fission.
  QGSC_CHIPS physics list uses the QGS model with the EnergyFlow
  interface to CHIPS at all energies. For the pA interactions the
  native CHIPS process G4QCollision is used below 290 MeV. The QGSC and
  G4QCollision processes are unified in one process by the CHIPS
  G4QDiscProcessMixer interface.
  Added the corresponding physics builders.
- Fixed G4EmLivermorePhysics, G4EmPenelopePhysics
- Fix in G4HadronInelasticQBBC: cross sections are created dynamically       (o)
  not by value, fission only instantiated for HP.
- Fix to address problem report #1056: all cross section data sets are       (o)
  created dynamically and no longer member of the class.
- Inline constructor and destructors are moved to source for classes:        (o)
  G4VNeutronBuilder, G4VPiKBuilder, G4VProtonBuilder, G4WarnPLStatus.

  step into two sub-steps occurs only for multiple-scattering regime.
- G4UrbanMscModel, G4UrbanMscModel2, G4UrbanMscModel90: use methods of
  G4VMscModel for interfacing to geometry.
