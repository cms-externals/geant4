------
- binmake.gmk: removed extra space characters in definition of TARGOBJEXT,   (o)
  fixing issue with target for main() not being rebuilt according to
  dependencies change. Addressing problem report #1098. 

global                                           global-V09-03-00
------
- Modified G4PhysicsVector to own a pointer to G4PVDataVector, instead having
  it by value. First attempt to separate RO and RW objects for thread-safety.

---------
- G4OpticalSurface: removed left-over debug test function OverWrite() from
  class declaration, also causing unnecessary dependency on G4ios.

-----------------------------------
- Beta version of G4PenelopeOscillator* classes to manage multi-element atomic
  oscillators used in Penelope Compton and Ionisation models. Compliant with
  Penelope-2008.
- Added dummy method ComputeCrossSectionPerAtom() in G4PenelopeRayleighModel, 
  never inkoved in tracking and issuing a warning if users access it via
  G4EmCalculator.
- Improved way of testing material in Geant4-DNA models.                     (+)

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V09-03-00           (+)
-------------------------------
- G4VEmProcess: added protection against negative cross section.             (o)
- G4VEnergyLossProcess: added protection against negative cross section, and
  improved logic in RetrieveTable() method.

processes/optical                                op-V09-03-00                (+)
-----------------
- Fixed problem of initialization of 'PropertyPointers', now set to NULL at
  the start of PostStepDoIt(). Addresses problem report #1094.

visualization/gMocren                            gMocren-V09-03-00           (+)
---------------------
- Fixed file-I/O bug in G4GMocrenFileViewer and G4GMocrenIO.
- G4GMocrenFileSceneHandler: fix to allow for porting on C++0x Standard:
  made explicit with static_cast conversions from double to float. Also use
  G4 types in consistent way. Removed debug code with printout.
