                       ===================

Major development/fixes included since the last development tag are:

 o New module 'externals' for optional external packages. Including: built-in
   "CLHEP" module, based on a subset of CLHEP classes imported from version
   CLHEP-2.1.0.1; built-in  "expat" module, from original expat-2.0.1.
 o Abilitated support for RayTracerX visualization driver with CMake builds.
 o New utility G4PhysicsListHelper for controlling process ordering
   in physics lists; adapted EM builders in physics-lists accordingly.
 o Switched Penelope-2008 as default Penelope models for EM low-energy.
 o Adopting 'base-material' approach in G4LossTablemanager, G4LossTableBuilder, G4VEmProcess, G4VMultipleScattering,
   G4VEnergyLossProcess. Physics vectors are built only for base materials and
   values are scaled for other materials.
 o Fixed case of large energy non-conservation for Hydrogen target in Binary
   Cascade hadronic model.
 o Use inverse kinematics in INCL light ion collisions, improving INCL
   light ion model performance in applications where we are interested in
   beam fragmentation.

cmake                                            cmake-V09-04-00             (+)
-----
- Abilitated support for RayTracerX visualization driver.
- Added G4VERBOSE compilation option as default, replicating the behaviour
  of the standard Geant4 Makefiles. The user can disable the option to remove
  the definition from the compile flags.
- Make installation of examples optional. Addresses problem report #1205.
  Also added the COMPONENT flag in the example install command with value
  'Examples' so that component based binary packages will also be able to
  make the install of the examples optional.
- Added G4_STORE_TRAJECTORY to global compile definitions.
  Addressing problem report #1208.
  Also added a CMake advanced option so that users can choose not to store
  trajectories, but by default this option is set to ON. This replicates the
  behaviour in the current Geant4 makefiles. The option is marked as advanced.
- Added .svn to list of patterns to exclude when installing directories.

  case of DLLs build on Windows. Partially addressing problem report #1189.
- Added default for CLHEP_BASE_DIR to built-in package in externals.
  Integrated flags in architecture.gmk and binmake.gmk for use of the
  CLHEP built-in package, and adapted setup for build of DLLs on Windows.
- Changed common.gmk to take into account sub-directories for headers
  installation.
- Workaround in binmake.gmk to avoid clashes with flag LDFLAGS set in the    (+)
  user's environment beforehand.
- Added flags to handle future driver OpenGLWt.
