                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last development tag are:

 o Replaced g77 with gfortran for Linux-g++ and Linux-icc platforms.
 o Fixes to G4TessellatedSolid and G4ExtrudedSolids.
 o Added new correction methods in order to provide a smooth transition

 o Fix in combined use of quasi-elastic/elastic hadronic models to correctly
   update parameters to sample T.

-------------------
- Added protection against NaN in G4Cons::GetPointOnSurface() in the case

------------------------
- G4TessellatedSolid:

- G4ExtrudedSolid:
  o Corrected triangularization of polygon, now correctly handling case
    of concave shapes.
  o Fix in Inside(p) for correctly handling the case of points located on
    the edges of triangles which are not the outline edges of the polygon.
    Added new internal method IsSameLineSegment() to be used instead of
    IsSameLine().
  o Fix in MakeFacets() to fill 'fTriangles' also in case of polygon with
    3 or 4 vertices, as they are needed for Inside(p).
- G4Polyhedra: fixed problem of out-of-bound access to vectors in
  GetPointOnSurface().
- Corrected order of arguments in G4Paraboloid constructor.

- G4MuMscModel: added sampling of tail distribution.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V09-01-05
----------------------------------
- G4eCoulombScatteringModel: speedup run-time computations using
  precomputed nuclear form-factors per element.
- G4BetheBlochModel: when computing dEdx for ions using new method
  IonBarkasCorrection().
- G4ionIonisation, G4ionGasIonisation:
  o Using new method to compute corrections IonHighOrderCorrections().
  o Added extra protections in computation of non-ionizing energy loss.
- G4IonFluctuations:
  o Added protection to the computation of the correction factor to dispersion
    which provide smooth transition to small velocities of an ion.
  o Added protection in computation of dispersion on allowing have a corrected
    dispersion below Bohr value.

-------------------------------
- G4EmSaturation: new helper class.
- G4EmCorrections:
  o Added IonBarkasCorrection(), IonHighOrderCorrections() and
    ComputeIonCorrections() methods in order to provide a smooth transition
    between low-energy parameterization and Bethe-Bloch model.
  o Added correction on effective charge for NIST materials in the
    'IonHighOrderCorrections' method.
- G4LossTableManager: added GetEmSaturation() method.
- G4ionEffectiveCharge: using precomputed Z^1/3 values, using expansions
  of exp() and pow() functions; do not perform recomputation if arguments
  of methods unchanged.

  particle.

processes/hadronic

    together with elastic, the parameters to sample T used to be not updated;
    the fix implies these to be always updated.
