                       ===================

Major development/fixes included since the last development tag are:

 o Activate construction of isotope-vector for all elements in G4Element;
   if user does not create isotopes, then vector of isotopes with natural
   abundances is created automatically using NIST data.
 o Use of same Bremsstrahlung model in all EM builders 
   and same e+e- pair production processes to mu+/mu-, pi+/pi-, K+K-,
   proton/anti_proton. Expected reduction of memory for physics tables
   and initialisation time for EM physics.
 o Added protection fix in all Urban multiple-scattering classes against
   big scattering angles for e+- (E > 20 MeV); the protection cuts
   tail of scattering angles to avoid artificial scattering of high energy e+-.
 o Decoupled calculation of Penelope ionisation cross-sections from the
   Ionisation model. Preliminary step for a future Penelope-specific
   atomic de-excitation model. Also preliminary step for a future
   Penelope-specific fluorescence model.
 o New classes G4PromptPhotonEvaporation, G4LevelManager, G4NucLevel, and
   G4LevelReader implementing new photon-evaporation model.
