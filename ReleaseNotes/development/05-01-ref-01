                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Fixes problem in G4PropagatorInField notice in release 5.1 and
    occasionally appearing as "Invalid Enum in [solid-type]".
  o Fixed behavior of function DefineWorldVolume() in G4RunManager
    to properly reset navigation history and optimisation in case the
    topology of the geometry has changed between runs.
  o Fixed infinite loop in binary-cascade model for hydrogen inelastic
    scattering.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:


geometry/solids/Boolean                 geom-bool-V05-01-00
-----------------------
- Added set/get methods for scale precision in G4ReflectionFactory.

geometry/volumes                        geomvol-V05-01-00
----------------
- G4PropagatorInField.cc: fix in ComputeStep() to avoid step computation
  if proposed step length is too small. Fixes problem noticed in release
  5.1 and occasionally appearing as "Invalid Enum in [solid-type]", also
  registered as problem report #485.

processes/electromagnetic/muons         muons-V05-01-01
-------------------------------
- Commented out debug printout in G4MuPairProduction.

processes/hadronic/models/generator/kinetic_model      ghad-bin-V05-01-00
-------------------------------------------------
- G4BinaryCascade: fix to cure infinite loop observed in inelastic
  scattering of hydrogen.

run                                     run-V05-01-01
---
- G4RunManager: fixed behavior of function DefineWorldVolume()
  to properly reset navigation history and optimisation in case the
  topology of the geometry has changed between runs. Now only a single
  call to DefineWorldVolume() is necessary when changing the geometry.
  Fixes also problem report #481.
  o Added new boolean argument (default set to TRUE) to specify if
    topology has changed.
  o Forced open/close geometry in method ResetNavigator() to properly
    reset G4Navigator status and remove old optimisations.

examples
--------
- extended:
  o electromagnetic
    + TestEm1 (testem1-V05-01-00)
      TestEm2 (testem1-V05-01-00)
      TestEm3 (testem3-V05-01-00)
      o Simplified mechanism for updating geometries between runs,
        according to changes in G4RunManager::DefineWorldVolume().
- novice
  o N04 (exampleN04-V05-00-02)
    + Correction to printout.

tests
-----
- test01 (test01-V05-01-00)
  test10 (test10-V05-01-00)
  test14 (test14-V05-01-00)
  test20 (test20-V05-01-00)
  test26 (test26-V05-01-00)
  o Simplified mechanism for updating geometries between runs,
    according to changes in G4RunManager::DefineWorldVolume().
