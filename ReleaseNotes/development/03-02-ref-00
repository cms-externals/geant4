			===================

Tags included in geant4-03-02-ref-00 since the last reference tag:

config - config-V03-01-10
------

  one general, and one for specific for transient and persistent each.
  Dependencies now much better handled in persistency. 
- A few bug fixes in binmake.gmk, common_objy.gmk, sys/SUN-CC5.gmk,
  sys/Linux-g++.gmk, sys/Win32-g++.gmk.

global - global-V03-01-02
------
- Added contructor to G4DataVector with additional argument 
  for initialising values of collection. 
- globals.hh: removed definition of cbrt() to allow ANSI compilation
  on Linux-g++ architecture with new compiler gcc-2.95-2.

event - event-V03-01-01
-----
- G4GeneralParticleSource, G4GeneralParticleSourceMessenger:
  o minor fixes to comments for Soft.Ref.Manual. 
  o added CVS headers, #ifdef protections to headers.

---------
- Cleared warnings detected on HP-aCC: explicitly initialising
  to zero values of G4DataVector used to fill sandia-table.

geometry/solids/BREPS - breps-V03-01-02
---------------------
- Fixes to allow -ansi compilation on Linux-g++, gcc-2.95-2 compiler: 
  o G4Ray.cc: changed usage of hypot(x,y) to sqrt(x*x+y*y). 
  o G4Hyperbola[.icc.cc]: changed usage of atanh(x) to 0.5*log((1+x)/(1-x)). 
- G4ProjectedSurface.cc: corrected initialisation of temporary G4Point3D 
  objects, to use the correct constructor, according to new CLHEP syntax.

geometry/solids/STEP - STEP-V03-01-00
--------------------
- Fix for porting on Linux-g++ 2.95-2 -ansi: 
  dirobj.cc: removed usage of strdup(), Replaced with existing
  solution for __O3DB__.

graphics_reps - greps-V03-01-05
-------------
- Explicit initialization for G4Point3D according to new CLHEP syntax.

persistency - persistency-V03-01-00
-----------
- Updated to new 'config' setup for persistency.
- Changed NULL to 0.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy - emlowen-V03-00-19
-----------------------------------
- Bug fix in antiproton ionisation.
- Bug fix in G4LowEnergyPolarizedCompton.

processes/hadronic - had-V03-02-01
------------------
  - Migration to STL vector of the pre-compound and evaporation codes and
    removal of most warnings detected by Linux ANSI pedantic setup.
  - Generator models:
    o Upgrade of angular distributions and fission yields in pre-compound
      and evaporation models.
    o Kinetic model: fixed exceptional condition for inelastic scattering
      off Hydrogene. No recoil required. 
  - Utilities:
    o Fixed bug in nuclear reactions for light ions. 

processes/hadronic/models/generator/de_excitation - de_excitation-V03-01-01
-------------------------------------------------
- Interface adjustment in G4ParaFissionModel.

processes/hadronic/models/generator/string_common - had_modgen_strcom-V03-01-00
-------------------------------------------------
- Explicit initialization of 'Qmomentum' according to new CLHEP syntax.

processes/hadronic/models/generator/util - hadgen_util-V03-01-00
----------------------------------------
- G4FermiMomentum.hh: defined local cbrt() to allow porting 
  on gcc-2.95-2 ANSI setup. 

processes/hadronic/models/high_energy - had_mod_high-V03-01-05
-------------------------------------
- Energy- OR Momentum- conservation, can be chosen by the user.
- Added production of Evaporation particles.
- Better description of experimental data, mainly in Strange
  Particle Production.    
- Cleared compilation warnings on Linux-g++.
- Minor bug-fix in G4HEPionMinusInelastic.
- Introduced temporary workaround in G4HEInelastic for high energy
  problem (number of particles created in one event larger than
  allocation).
- Missing initialization of strangeness corrected, removing energy
  non-conservation in rare cases.

processes/hadronic/models/low_energy - low_energy-V03-01-00
------------------------------------
- Removed 'static_cast' not supported on SUN-CC (non-ISO).

processes/hadronic/models/neutron_hp - neu-V03-01-03
------------------------------------
- New code revision: requires new set of data, G4NDL3.0 or later.
- Includes also an upgrade of the doppler broadening.
  Allows for running on 0K data, and doing exact doppler broadening
  on the fly (according to the temperature specified in G4Material),
  with good performance up to about 5000K.
- Bug fix in G4NeutronHPInelasticCompFS to get the correct Q-value
  for Lithium (the bug was introduced in recent development).

processes/transportation - transport-V03-01-02
------------------------
- Corrected 'spin-update' in G4Transportation.cc from overwriting
  the value of the spin for photons and other non-charged particles.

run - run-V03-01-00
---
- Added binary mode for G4VUserPhysicsList::Retrieve/StorePhysicsTable().
- Added G4VUserPhysicsList::RetrieveCutValues and related.
- Added G4VUserPhysicsList::Set/ResetStoredInAscii() 
  to switch on ascii mode for Retrieve/StorePhysicsTable().
- Added setStoredInAscii command in G4UserPhysicsList .
- Changed date in G4RunManager.cc for release 3.2.

tracking - tracking-V03-01-02
--------
- Cleared warnings on G4SteppingManager detected on HP-aCC:
  Explicitly initialised values in STL collections members. 

visualization - vis-V03-01-07
-------------
- Added /vis/drawTree.
- Introduced first version of G4GAGTree to dump geometry hierarchy
  to GAG GUI system.
  This requires two new environment variables:
  G4VIS_BUILD_GAGTREE_DRIVER and G4VIS_USE_GAGTREE.
- Removed OS dependence from the DAWN-network driver. 
  * gethostname() removed 
  * removed G4SocketConfig.hh and G4SocketMacro.hh. 
  NOTE: now "setenv G4DAWN_HOST_NAME hostname" is mandatory to use 
        the DAWN-network driver.
