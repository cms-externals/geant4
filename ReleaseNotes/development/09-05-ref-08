  excitation energy from base material and not recompute from scratch.

    any user-configured environment variables. Default values for parameters
    are provided. Three new flags are also defined: G4CASCADE_VERBOSE (pre-set

    (select use of PreCompoundModel in G4CascadeInterface constructor),
    G4NUCMODEL_USE_BEST (re-set all defaults for nuclear model with physical
    units).
  o G4CascadeInterface: added new function for dumping configuration.
- models/chiral_inv_phase_space/body (hadr-chips-body-V09-05-08)

    be used for very light systems (e.g. p+alpha).
  o Fixes some minor memory leaks and Coverity warnings.

    Those reactions are handled by binary-cascade.
