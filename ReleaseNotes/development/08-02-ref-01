---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------


Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

    + Added handling of user-defined isotopes: re-implemented methods
      GetMeanFreePath() and ChooseAandZ() to use new methods in
      G4CrossSectionDataStore.
    + No longer use dispatch pointer to call data store methods.
    + Data members currentZ, currentN and methods GetCurrentZ(),
      GetCurrentN() removed as no longer needed.
