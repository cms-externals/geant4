                       ===================

 Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last
 recommended reference tag are:
     - first stand-alone implementation of G4RayTracer
     - re-implementation of G4Polyhedron, now based on HepPolyhedron
     - corrections for trajectories of suspended tracks
     - fixes to STLInterface wrappers

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the full list of changes is the following:

config
------
- Added control for the Ray-tracer driver (G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER and
  G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER).
- Added G4NO_OPTIMISE for compilation with no optimisation level,
  and added G4DEBUG and G4OPTIMISE to CPPFLAGS.
- Fixed dependency linking order for compound libraries.

event
-----
- Corrections for trajectories of suspended tracks. 

global
------
- Fixes to STLInterface wrappers: G4String::toUpper/toLower bug fix
  and boundary checking in access operators for vectors.
- Added string identifier to G4UserLimits.

graphics representations
------------------------
- Added HepPolyhedron and re-implemented G4Polyhedron using this
  new class (which will become part of CLHEP).

hadronics
---------
- Fix for the 'no data' problem seen in the neutron transport tests.

low-energy electromagnetics
---------------------------
- Fixes to electron and photon low energy processes.
- Fixes for ISO compliance.

particles
---------
- Fixes in G4IsotopeTable classes.

tracking & track
----------------
- Added protection for null pointers in
  G4SteppingManager::SetUserAction().
- Fixed bug in track weight in G4VParticleChange.

visualization
-------------
- Introduced first implementation of standalone G4RayTracer. 

examples
--------
- Introduced large_N input macros.
- Updated N03.out and N04.EMtest.out.
