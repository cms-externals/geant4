Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                  config-V06-00-03
------
- architecture.gmk:
  o Protected OGLFLAGS against containing -I/usr/include which may
    cause wrong includes to be picked up.
- WIN32-VC7.gmk: added material to build shared-libs for Windows (DLLs).
- Added program win32def.c to help building DLLs, built from
  source/GNUmakefile through a specialised target and placed in
  $G4LIB/$G4SYSTEM.
- Added configuration file Linux-icc.gmk for Intel/icc compiler
  on Linux systems.
- Configure script:
  o Corrected defaults for shared-libs build.

geometry/magneticfield                  field-V06-00-00
----------------------
- G4UniformMagField:
  o Added missing implementation for GetConstantFieldValue().
    Fixes bug report #575.

geometry/navigation                     geomnav-V06-00-00
-------------------
- G4PropagatorInField:
  o Modified ReEstimateEndpoint() to cope with a failure of AccurateAdvance(),
    by calling it iteratively up maximum 20 times.
  o Fix in SetVerboseLevel(): now forwarding the verbosity to integration
    driver.

materials                               materials-V06-00-01
---------
- Fixed problem in destructor of G4SandiaTable.
- GNUmakefile: experimentally modified to provide an example of macro
  GLOBLIBS used by the DLL builder in order to have global lib dependencies.

particles                               particles-V06-00-01
---------
- Updated mass and width to meet with PDG 2002 data.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy              emlowen-V06-00-01
-----------------------------------
- Implemented optimization of Bremsstrahlung angular generators.

processes/electromagnetic/muons                  muons-V06-00-01
-------------------------------
- Updated parameterizations in G4MuPairProductionModel.
- Updated radiative corrections for G4MuBetheBlochModel.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               stand-V06-00-03
----------------------------------
- Minor fixes in G4PAIonisation and G4PAIModel.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  utils-V06-00-04
-------------------------------
- Minor cleanup in ionisation models.

processes/hadronic                               ghad-V06-00-04
------------------
- management:
  o Fix for suspended particles. Solves a problem seen in neutron_hp
    elastic scattering.
- chiral_inv_phase_space/body (ghad-chips-body-V06-00-02):
  o Major improvement of the CHIPS nuclear fragmentation model: in
    addition to Lambdas, now Sigmas, Xi, and Omega hyperons are added to
    the fragmentation algorithm (together with N+Sigma and NN+Sigma nuclear
    fragments); Delta isobars together with iso-nuclei are implemented as an
    intermediate states of fragmentation; all leptons are added to the
    CHIPSWorld of particles, so that now the CHIPS model is ready for nuclear
    muon-minus capture at rest process and for the neutrino-nuclear reactions.
    In addition, starting this version the weak decays of particles can be
    included in CHIPS. All these changes make CHIPS more flexible in simulation
    of pions and strange particles production.
    As the phase space distribution is changed the new version of CHIPS needs
    additional tuning of the internal parameters with the physics tests.
    Delta-,Delta- below the n,n,pi-,pi- threshold is resolved.
- chiral_inv_phase_space/interface:
  o Porting of experimental interface classes.
  o Provided implementation of missing cases which was cause of crashes in
    ATLAS production.
- neutron_hp:
  o Fixed conflict with system variable name.
- parton_string:
  o Lower bound added to transverse mass distribution, to enable
    diffractive scattering for gammas. Was cause of a crash in ATLAS
    productions.

processes/optical                                op-V06-00-02
-----------------
- G4OpBoundaryProcess:
  o Added process status "NotAtBoundary", "SameMaterial", "StepTooSmall",
    "NoRINDEX". Allowing for a skin-surface between mother and daughter
     volumes, with the daughter skin taking precedence.
  o Fix in the initialization at the beginning of its DoIt(), now set to
    "Undefined". This should allow a user to correctly get the process flag
    from the UserSteppingAction() through the public function GetStatus()
    even when the (forced) DoIt() was called when the optical photon track
    was not at a boundary, or when medium1 == medium2.

process/transportation                           transport-V06-00-00
----------------------
- Fixed a bug in G4UserSpecialCuts related to 'charged-geantino'.

---
- Updated date to run-manager kernel.

visualization/HepRep                             vis-HepRep-V06-00-04
--------------------
- Fixed handling of symbols zcalloc and zcfree of the zlib library being
  called as C++ mangled names. 
- Renamed zutil.h, zlib.h and zconf.h into HepRep-zutil.h, ... to avoid
  conflicts with those files on Unix systems if /usr/include or
  /usr/local/include is on the include search path.
- Fixed compilation problems on Intel-icc compiler.

visualization/management                         visman-V06-00-00
------------------------
- Fixed compilation problems on Intel-icc compiler. Added missing
  forward declaration of G4VisStateDependent to G4VisManager.

visualization/OpenGL                             opengl-V06-00-00
--------------------
- Fixed wrong order of statements in G4OpenGLXViewer desctructor.
  Fixes bug report #581.

examples                                         examples-V06-00-01
--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- advanced:
  o analysis/A01 (exampleA01-V06-00-00)

- extended/electromagnetic:
  o TestEm5 (testem5-V06-00-00)
    + Modified histo 7: projected position at exit.
    + RunAction: removed UI commands for visualisation,
                 added a function ComputeMscHighland().
  o TestEm7 (testem7-V06-00-00)
    + Removed "add binary" from TestEm7.in macro.

-----
- Updated reference outputs.
- tests/test40 (test40-V06-00-01)
  o Fixed compilation problem on gcc-3.2 in RunAction for usage
    of std stream manipulators.
