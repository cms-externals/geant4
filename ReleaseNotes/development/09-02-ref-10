Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V09-02-12
------
- Added new gMocren include path to G4VIS_USE.gmk script and flags for
  backward compatibility in G4VIS_BUILD.gmk.
  Removed references to obsolete GAGTREE driver.

-----------
- Added few accessors for visualization to G4VScoringMesh.

geometry/management                              geommng-V09-02-04           (o)
-------------------
- Clear possible excess capacity in node vectors in G4SmartVoxelHeader
  BuildNodes() method. May reduce excess memory allocated in optimisation
  in medium/large detector setups, at the price of a slight time increase
  in initialisation for geometry voxelisation.
- G4VTouchable: moved inline vitual methods, constructor and destructor to
  source, to avoid problem of memory alignment in allocation of derived objects.

geometry/volumes                                 geomvol-V09-02-04           (o)
----------------
- Use G4Allocator for dynamic allocation of G4TouchableHistory objects.
  Should reduce the number of direct calls to malloc and memory fragmentation.
  Measured an average improvement of ~5% in CPU speed with same memory
  footprint. Moved inline constructors to source to avoid problems of memory
  alignment in allocation.

global                                           global-V09-02-08
------
- Cleared warning for unused argument in G4Allocator internal method.

  tricky cases in LHCb visualization.
- HepPolyhedron: removed static instance of BooleanProcessor; removed
  IsErrorBooleanProcess, use HepPolyhedronProcessor instead.
- BooleanProcessor.src: changes contributed from LHCb to "loop on shifts"
