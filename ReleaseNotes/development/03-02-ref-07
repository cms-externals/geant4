                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included since "geant4-03-02-ref-05" reference
tag are:

  o Removed STLInterface module. Full migration to STL completed.
  o Introduced new geometry module "verification" for checking of
    geometry volumes overlaps. Added geometry messenger to kernel.
  o Added utility to geometry manager to print CPU statistics for
    geometry optimisation.
  o Fixed irreproducibility problem due to internal state in mag-field
    management.
  o Introduced ability to reflect volumes and hierarchies of volumes
    for placements based on CSG solids.
  o Introduced fluorescence in ionisation for low energy EM processes.
  o Major updates and fixes in the hadronic domain.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

analysis				analysis-V03-02-00
--------
- G4VAnalysisMAnager.hh: removal of inclusion of cstring.h.

config                                  config-V03-02-08
------
- Removed references to STLInterface module in architecture.gmk
  and architecture setups. 
- binmake.gmk: added include path for geometry/verification module.

event                                   event-V03-02-06
-----
- Minor fixes to comply with removal of STLInterface.

geometry                                geometry-V03-02-01
--------
- Introduced geometry/verification module for checking geometry for
  volumes overlaps.
- Magnetic field:
  added method in G4ChordFinder to erase/reset the state of the
  StepEstimate. This is unwanted internal state that was carried
  between tracks and events as a side effect.
  Calling this at the start of each track, it is now possible to
  eliminate a reported problem of non-repeatability.
- Management:                          (geommng-V03-02-01)
  o Added definition of G4TouchableHandle.
  o Added class G4SmartVoxelStat for statistics on geometry optimisation
    of volumes through voxelisation.
  o Modified G4GeometryManager to make use of G4SmartVoxelStat when run
    in verbose mode:
    - added argument to CloseGeometry() method for verbosity
    - added ReportVoxelStats() method for reporting optimisation statistics.
- Solids/Boolean:
  o Introduced first implementation of classes G4ReflectedSolid and
    G4ReflectionFactory for reflections of positioned volumes.
  o Fixed bug in G4ReflectedSolid::CreatePolyhedron().
- Volumes:                             (geomvol-V03-02-00b)
  o Fixed initialisation of fEpsilonMin in G4PropagatorInField 
    constructor.
  o Introduced G4GeometryMessenger associated to G4TransportationManager
    with following commands defined:
    - geometry/test/run - to start verification of geometry for overlapping
                          regions based on standard grid setup.
    - geometry/test/line_test - to activate test along a specified direction
                                and position user defined.
    - geometry/test/position - to specify position for the line_test.
    - geometry/test/direction - to specify direction for the line_test.
    - geometry/test/tolerance - to customise test precision.
    - geometry/navigator/reset - for resetting navigation history
                                 and position.

global                                  global-V03-02-05
------
- Removed STLinterface module:
  o renamed cstring[.h.icc] to G4String[.hh.icc] and placed
    in management/include.
  o renamed ctoken.h to G4Tokenizer.hh and placed in management/include.
- Introduced G4ReferenceCountedHandle templated class.
- Added <deque> wrapper in include/g4std.

  (similarly for elements with isotopes) 
- Removed all static inline methods in G4Isotope, G4Element, G4Material
  and G4SandiaTable.
