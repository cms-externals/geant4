                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last development tag are:

 o Fixed incorrect volume size for cylindrical parameterized volume used in
   various scorers.
 o Added possibility to check for overlaps by activating/de-activating the
   built-in surface check for placement and parameterised volumes, when
   loading GDML detector descriptions.
 o Completed migration of Penelope low-energy models to standard package
   design and started migration for DNA processes.
 o Added G4RayleighScattering low-energy process to describe Rayleigh
   scattering. Updated Livermore photon processes classes for handling of
   compound materials.


---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

(*)  Fixes included in release 9.2.p01

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V09-01-17            (*)
------
- Added -lXi to X11LIBS for Linux-g++, Linux-icc and WIN32-g++ configurations,
  required for correct linkage with OpenInventor Coin3D libraries.
- Configure script (Configure-V09-02-01): corrected handling of G4LEDATA and
  G4LEVELGAMMADATA paths in generated configuration scripts. Addresses problem
  report #1037 and #1039.

digits_hits                                      digits_hits-V09-02-00       (*)
-----------
- Fixed incorrect volume size for cylindrical parameterized volume used in
  various scorers.

geometry/navigation                              geomnav-V09-02-00           (*)
-------------------
- Added G4RegularNavigationHelper class, used by G4RegularNavigation for
  counting the number of step lengths in each voxel of the regular structure.
- Some code cleanup.

global                                           global-V09-02-00            (*)
------
- Correction in management/GNUmakefile to CPPFLAGS, adding G4RF_DEBUG in
  case enabled.

particles/management                             partman-V09-02-00           (*)
--------------------
- Optimisation fix to G4IonTable::IsIon() implementation for the usage of
  strings.

persistency/ascii                                ascii-V09-02-02             (*)
-----------------
- Fixed bug in definition of delta angle for all solids with section in Phi
  in G4tgbVolume: take into consideration geometrical tolerance.

persistency/gdml                                 gdml-V09-02-01              (*)
----------------
- Added possibility to check overlaps by activating/de-activating the
  built-in surface check for placement and parameterised volumes.
  By default the overlap check is off. To activate it, use call to the
  parser 'SetOverlapCheck(true)' before reading the GDML file.
- Changed post-fix"_refl" to "_PV" for placements made through the
  reflection-factory.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy             emlowen-V09-02-08
-----------------------------------
- Added G4PenelopeBremsstrahlungModel, namely Bremsstrahlung according to
  Penelope model, migrated to the Std-design (inheriting from G4VEmModel).
  A few minor cleaning of G4PenelopeBremsstrahlungContinuous and
  G4PenelopeIonisation. Completed migration to Std package design for all
  Penelope processes.
- Added G4RayleighScattering process (G4VEmProcess) to describe Rayleigh
  scattering, not available within the Std package.
- Added preliminary migrated Geant4-DNA processes and models.
- Updated Livermore photon processes classes for handling of compound materials.
  Added pointer removal protections.
- Added ability for DNA charge change processes to kill particle without
  total energy deposit.
- Corrected energy limits in G4CrossSectionIonisationBornPartial.            (*)
- Added proton case in G4CrossSectionExcitationMillerGreenPartial and added
  protection (waterExcitation.ExcitationEnergy).
- Added angle initialisation in G4DNAScreenedRutherfordElasticModel.
- Edited G4PenelopePhotoElectric and G4PenelopePhotoElectricModel to suppress
  a warning message from G4AtomicTransitionManager appearing for some elements
  (Oxygen, Fluorine). This is due to the fact that Penelope and
  G4AtomicTransitionManager databases may contain a different number of shells.
  Physics results are unchanged.                                             (*)

processes/optical                                op-V09-02-00                (*)
-----------------
- Fix to G4OpBoundaryProcess to address problem report #1040.

examples                                         examples-V09-02-01
--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- extended/electromagnetic/TestEm5 (testem5-V09-02-00)
  o Added command "/testem/phys/cutLimit" allowing to change low limit for
    production threshold.
  o Added missing notification to G4RunManager when geometry or material are
    modified between runs.
  o Added PAI models configuration to Physics List
  o Extended number of runs  and use Opt3 physics-list in TestEm5.in.
  o Modified cuts in PhysicsList: SetEnergyRange(1*eV,100*GeV).
  o Added blaha.mac input macro.
- extended/medical/DICOM (DICOM-V09-02-00)                                   (*)
  o Use new class G4RegularNavigationHistory for counting of step
    lengths in voxels of the regular structure.
- extended/persistency/gdml/G02 (G02-V09-02-00)                              (*)
  o Corrected loading of default geometry with assembly, resolving some
    overlaps introduced by mistake.
