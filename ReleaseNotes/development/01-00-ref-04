                       ===================

   This is the first of a regular series of recommended reference tags
 that we plan to 'publish' each month. These versions of the Geant4
 toolkit are released to the experiments and other groups within the
 collaboration. The aim is to aid in regularly obtaining an up-to-date 
 tested version of the Geant4 toolkit.  These versions will include
 all tested fixes, major or minor, and those developments that have
 been tested and have passed our testing procedure.

 Note that this reference-tag includes the recent ISO/ANSI migration.
 
 Some of the improvements and fixes included are
     - extension of the anti-proton energy loss down to 1 keV
     - correction of a truncation problem in G4Poisson.hh
     - CSG/G4Trap: fixed error in DistanceToIn(p,v).

 Compiler versions for ISO/ANSI
 ------------------------------

 You can choose to compile utilising an ISO/ANSI compiler (or compiler
 option), as this reference-tag includes the recent ISO/ANSI migration.
 In order to test your code with strict-ansi setup, you need to do
 the following:

 - on DEC-cxx (dxplus.cern.ch, cxx version 6.1):   (*)

   unsetenv G4USE_OSPACE  <--- if set. To allow use of the Native STL
   setenv CLHEP_BASE_DIR /afs/cern.ch/sw/geant4/dev/CLHEP/DEC-cxx/iso

   Selecting the ISO installation of CLHEP is required and will
   become soon the default on DEC.

 - on SUN-CC (version 5.0):                        (**)

   setenv G4SYSTEM SUN-CC5
   unsetenv G4USE_OSPACE  <--- if set. To allow use of the Native STL
   remove the default /opt/SUNWspro/bin from your $PATH
   and substitute it with /opt/SUNWspro50/bin

   An ISO installation of CLHEP is already located in the usual
   area set by the default CLHEP_BASE_DIR.

 Notes:
 (*)  a bug in cin.getline() system function causes an anomalous
      behavior when running in interactive-mode on DEC-cxx 6.1. We
      tested the bug has been fixed in the new compiler version 6.2.
 (**) on SUN-CC 5.0 some files cannot be compiled if optimisation is
      turned on (the default), set G4DEBUG instead.
      A bug report is being filed with SUN support.

 - Other compilers which support ISO/ANSI are:
     o HP-aCC (hpplus.cern.ch, A.01.18 or greater) with Native STL.
     o Win/NT-VC++ 6.0 with Native STL.
   Please, refer to the release notes of the recent public release
   1.0 for the complete list of supported compilers and setups
   (ISO/non-ISO).
 
---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

In detail, the full list of changes is:

event
-----
- G4EventManager becomes a singleton, to allow access to it directly, 
  rather than through G4RunManager.
- Minor correction for null pointer protection in G4StackManager.

geometry
--------
- CSG/G4Trap: fixed bug in DistanceToIn(p,v).
- G4DrawVoxels.cc: added protection in GetSlice().

global
------
- G4Poisson:  Fixed truncation problem in Poisson distribution
  implementation
- globals.hh:   added check on definition of CLHEP_MAX_MIN_DEFINED.
- G4UnitsTable: added constructor to G4BestUnit for 3vectors.

low-energy electromagnetics
---------------------------
- anti-proton energy loss updated to provide simulation down to 1 keV 
   (in previous version it's lower limit was 0.5 MeV).
- G4ionLowEnergyIonisation: minor bug fix.

visualization
-------------
- Added some protections for no viewer, no voxelisation. 
- Added /vis/viewer/refresh. 
- Fix for ISO in VRML. 
- General handling of displaced solid, introduced /vis/viewer/show.

graphics representations
------------------------
- Fix for spheres with small dtheta.
- Added G4Polyhedron::Transform and InvertFacets.

examples
--------
- N02, N03: Introduced ExN0nSteppingVerbose.
- N04: Introduced 10 TeV mu- in exampleN04.EMtest.in. 
- All reference files updated.
- In extended/electromagnetic (testem-V01-00-00):
  - new TestEm6 (low energy): tests protons, anti_protons, ionC12.
