                       ===================

Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last
recommended reference tag are:
    - major restructure of geometry/solids/CSG module.
      Created new module solids/specific for generic shapes.
    - new developments in low-energy electromagnetic processes.
    - ability to visualise Boolean solids through G4Polyhedron
      objects.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the full list of changes is the following:

config
------
- Added path to new geometry modue geometry/solids/specific.
- Updated filtering script for STEP files g4step_correct.pl.

hadronics
---------
- hadronic/models/neutron_hp: bug-fixes and improvements concerning
  Q-values on Lithium-6, gamma production on Iron56, and triton
  production on B-10.

electromagnetic processes
-------------------------
- Low-energies processes:
  o modifications for integration of cross sections, corrections of
    fluorescence transition probabilities to take into account
    non-radiative transitions.
  o fixes in G4LowEnergyBremsstrahlung for continuous energy loss.
  o updated system test test14 and extended-example testem6.

geometry
--------
- magneticfield:
  o corrected signature to function DumbStepper() in classes:
    G4HelixExplicitEuler, G4HelixHeum, G4HelixImplicitEuler,
    G4HelixSimpleRunge and G4MagHelicalStepper.
  o corrected signature and implementation of function
    MagFieldEvaluate() in G4MagHelicalStepper, to use Field (as
    ThreeVector) in place of dydx.
  o made Richardson extrapolation optional in G4MagHelicalStepper.
  o updated unit test testPropagateMagField and reference output.
  o fix in G4LineSection to prevent divisions by 0 and sqrt(<0).
- management:
  o design change in G4VSolid, changed pure virtual method
    G4VSolid::GetExtent() to virtual. Added default implementation
    based on CalculateExtent().
- solids:
  o fixes to G4Tubes and G4Hype.
  o removed implementations of GetExtent() in most sub-classes
    of G4VSolid.
  o fixed implementations of visualization utility method
    DescribeYourselfTo().
  o restructured CSG directory and created new module solids/specific.
  o added new shape in solids/specific: G4EllipticalTube.
  o created new directory solids/test and moved test suites "SBT"
    and "Fred" therein.
- solids/Boolean:
  o CreatePolyhedron implemented for BooleanSolids.
  o G4DisplacedSolid: reversed implementation of GetFrameRotation and
    GetObjectRotation, removing inappropriate invertion.
  o G4DisplacedSolid::GetConstituentMovedSolid() made const.

visualization
-------------
- Added ability to visualise boolean solids through G4Polyhedron
  objects:
  o Made G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid() virtual. No longer
    deals with composite solids - now programmed into
    CompositeSolid::CreatePolyhedron().
  o G4PhysicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid() no longer deals with
    displaced solids - now programmed into
    G4DisplacedSolid::CreatePolyhedron().
  o Added G4LogicalVolumeModel::DescribeSolid(), which explicitly adds
    components of composite solids as white forced-wireframe objects.
  o Removed unnecessary #includes from G4VSceneHandler.hh.
