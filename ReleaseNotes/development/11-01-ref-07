    anti_kaon0 (transformed in kaon0S and kaon0L) to maximum one warning
    per thread.
- models/de_excitation (hadr-deex-V11-01-05)
  o G4LevelManager, G4PhotonEvaporation: improved method names.
  o G4LevelReader: set life time of stable levels to DBL_MAX instead of -1;
    left undefined spin 99 and do not set it to zero.
  o G4ExcitationHandler: instantiate FermiBreakUp, MultiFragmentation, and
    PhotonEvaporation in constructor. Code formatting.
  o Reviewed and updated the fermi_breakup model, to address problem
    report #2263. Removed few obsolete classes. Added G4FermiBreakUpUtil class.
  o G4VEvaporation, G4Evaporation, G4VEvaporationFactory, G4EvaporationFactory,
    G4EvaporationGEMFactory, G4EvaporationGEMFactoryVI and
    G4EvaporationDefaultGEMFactory: more accurate instantiation/destruction
    of components. Code formatting.

  o Removed unused files.
- models/inclxx (had-inclxx-V11-01-02)
  o G4INCLPbarAtrestEntryChannel, G4INCLCascade, G4INCLNucleus: fixed
    Coverity reported defects.
- models/particle_hp (hadr-hpp-V11-01-14)
  o Renamed classes for capture from G4ParticleHP to G4NeutronHP, as capture
    process exists only for neutrons; removed old commented lines in modified
    files.
  o Removed unused G4NeutronHP*.hh headers for elastic and inelastic.
  o G4ParticleHPManager: check all environment variables once; provided new
    methods to access path to data. Use G4ParticleHPManager for directory
    names and various flags. Code clean-up.
  o G4ParticleHPContAngularPar, G4ParticleHPContEnergyAngular,
    G4ParticleHPEnAngCorrelation, G4ParticleHPNames, G4ParticleHPProduct:
    use new interfaces to G4ParticleHPManager, moved constructors, destructors, 
    and some other methods to source; removed unused commented lines.
  o G4ParticleHPEnAngCorrelation: fixed reported Coverity defect and minor
    code cleanup.
  o In CMake script, use alphabetical order both for headers and for source
    files.
- models/pre_equilibrium (hadr-pre-V11-01-00)
  o Use the default Coulomb barrier computation, Code cleanup: code formatting;
    removed unused data and methods.
- models/qmd (hadr-qmd-V11-01-02)
  o G4QMDMeanField: removing unused map.
  o G4QMDReaction: do not create local G4Evaporation class, only define 
    type of evaporation for local G4ExcitationHandler.

processes/scoring                                procscore-V11-01-02

---
- G4PhysicsListHelper: removed the unused code related to reading from the
  file OrderingParameterTable (which has been deleted).

visualization
-------------
- management (visman-V11-01-19)
  o G4VViewer: limit the depth of expansion of the scene tree touchables.
    This is to prevent the trees of complex detector running off the page.
    All touchables are entered but could be in a collapsed item, viewable by
    expanding the mother with a left click.
    Applied clang-format.
  o Remove obsolete attempt at flying (interpolation with splines).
    Functionality now delegated to G4ViewParameters.
  o Fized problem of local axes not appearing, by adding "/vis/viewer/refresh"
    after "/vis/touchable/localAxes".
- modeling (modeling-V11-01-06)
  o G4PhysicalVolumeModel: introducing touchable count. A new function
    GetNumberOfTouchables() returns a map with the number of touchables by
    depth of the geometry tree. Used in G4VViewer when deciding whether to
    expand the scene tree.
- OpenGL (opengl-V11-01-09)
  o Fixed precision-loss warning.
  o Fixed reported Coverity defects.
- OpenInventor (openinventor-V11-01-06)
  o Fixed reported Coverity defects.
- Qt3D (visQt3D-V11-01-04)
  o Fixed precision-loss warning.
- ToolsSG (vis_toolssg-V11-01-10)
  o G4ToolsSGViewer: protected null scene pointer, in case user forgets
    to create a scene.
  o G4ToolsSGQtViewer renamed to G4ToolsSGQtGLESViewer for consistency with
    the file naming pattern applied in other sub-drivers.
