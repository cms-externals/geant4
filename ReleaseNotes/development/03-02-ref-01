                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included since the last reference
tag are:

  o Modified G4Exception behavior, now setting G4StateManager to
    "abort" state instead of aborting the application.
  o Cleanup of pedantic warnings in Linux-g++ ANSI setup for several
    modules.
  o Migration to STL vector for the "persistency" and "g3tog4" modules.
  o Removed old-style visualization commands and fixed bug for replica
    rotation matrix which was causing crashes in replica tracking with
    visualisation.
