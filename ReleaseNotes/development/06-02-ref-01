                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o New implementation of G4Allocator based on a pool of memory-chunks.
    The size of a single chunk is kept at 1Kb as for the old allocator.
    This implementation replaces the old G4Allocator based on pages and
    no longer portable on the new gcc-3.4.0 compiler.
  o Correction in G4MscModel::SampleCosTheta() for high-energy particles
    at small step. Fixes some observed deflection of direction for particles
    at high energies.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following (tags marked with (*)
are also included in the public patch-01 to release 6.2):

  allow for porting on gcc-3.4.X.

event                                            events-V06-02-00	(*)
-----
- Trivial fixes for removal of redundant semicolons in the code, to
  allow for porting on gcc-3.4.X.

geometry/divisions                               divisions-V06-02-00	(*)
------------------
- Removed unnecessary forward declaration of HepTransform3D from
  G4ParameterisationBox and G4VDivisionParameterisation.

geometry/navigation                              geomnav-V06-02-00	(*)
-------------------
- Fixed zero step-length problem in G4ReplicaNavigation::ComputeStep()
  for cases where different replica types are coincident.
  Resolves problem report #633.
- G4NormalNavigation: added extra verbosity to print out information
  for each solid which returns a 'lowest-yet' step, including the mother
  volume. It is activated by setting verbose level to 2 or more.

geometry/solids/BREPS                            breps-V06-02-00	(*)
---------------------

  Fixed usage of tolerances fir handling surface distances.
  Implemented SurfaceNormal(p) to follow original specifications for G4VSolid.
- G4BREPSolid: fixed usage of tolerances for handling surface distances.
- Some code cleanup.

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V06-02-00	(*)
-------------------
- Fixes curing rare conditions of loops at boundaries for G4Orb and G4Sphere.
  Addresses problem report #547.

------
- New implementation of G4Allocator based on a pool of memory-chunks.
  The size of a single chunk is kept at 1Kb as for the old allocator.
  This implementation replaces the old G4Allocator based on pages and no
  longer portable on the new gcc-3.4.0 compiler.
  The new allocator also supports the standard interface required for STL
  containers, in case it will be used as alternative allocator instead of
  the default std::allocator.
  o New classes: G4AllocatorPool
  o Removed classes: G4AllocatorPage, G4AllocatorUnit.
- Added unit test for allocation of std::vector collections.
