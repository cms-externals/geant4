Tags included in geant4-04-00-ref-00 since the last reference tag:

source/analysis					analysis-V03-02-01
---------------
- Removed analysis module. AIDA 2.2 or higher should now be adopted.

source/geometry/magneticfield			field-V03-02-08
-----------------------------
- Minor fixes:
  o G4CashKarpRKF45: fixed deletion of unassigned pointer/array in
    destructor.
  o G4EqMagElectricField: fixed formula for inverse velocity.
- G4FieldManager: added fFieldChangesEnergy data member and get/set
  methods (required to allow transportation to know how to calculate
  end-time, enabling the integration of time only for electric fields).
- Fixed interface to virtual functions in the inheritance chain.
  Added 'virtual' qualifier to destructor and GetFieldValue() for
  subclasses of G4Field which may act as base class for user-defined
  fields.
  Modified files: G4MagneticField.hh, G4UniformElectricField[.hh.cc],
                  G4UniformMagField.hh.
- G4ChordFinder.cc: the unphysical curve length exception has been
  moved to inside #ifdef G4DEBUG_FIELD. Other #ifdef renamed to
  G4DEBUG_FIELD.
- G4LineSection[.hh.cc]: correction for A=B when the distance from P
  to A is returned.

source/geometry/solids/STEP			STEP-V03-02-01
---------------------------
- Fixes for compilation on gcc-2.96.98 and gcc-3.0.2 compilers to
  overcome warnings produced and fix std namespace problems in
  sdaiString.cc.

source/geometry/solids/STEPinterface		stepinterface-V03-02-01
------------------------------------
- Fix to GNUmakefile for compilation on gcc-2.96.98 and gcc-3.0.2
  compilers to overcome warnings produced by strict ANSI compilation.

source/geometry/volumes				geomvol-V03-02-08
-----------------------
- G4PropagatorInField:
  o Added thresholds for number of steps with get/Set methods
  o Modified choice of subsequent step size in case of Zero steps
    - decrease quickly at first to try to ensure that the first/second
      "re-steps" are enough in most cases.
    - utilise addition threshold parameters (for # of steps) to slow
      down the rate of decrease of the step size for the 'difficult'
      cases which do not converse after a few steps.                           
  o Added use of new Largest Acceptable Step data member.
  o Protected, in reseting of Proposed Step length, against
    making it bigger in cases where several zero steps seen.
  o Several debugging prints added. (only in G4Verbose, ...)
  o Added GetCurrentFieldManager() method.
  o Added 'maximum' epsilon value in G4PropagatorInField, as some
    ill-conditions appear to be due to large proposed relative errors.
- G4Navigator:
  o Fixed mirroring of the input argument for global direction into
    local variable in LocateGlobalPointAndSetup().
  o Added ResetState() method (that only reset state - not stack).
  o Added optional argument for direction to
    LocateGlobalPointAndSetup().
  o State is now resetted when touchable history is used to
    re-initialise it.
  o Direction in LocateGlobalPointAndSetup() methods is now used.
  o Added kNormal and Copy Number to NewLevel (Navigation Level) for
    Normal Navigation. Now all TouchableHistory objects should have a
    valid entry in ReplicaNumber:
    - in the case of a placement volume it will be the copy number
    - in replicated volumes it will be the replica number.

source/global					global-V03-02-07
-------------
- Fixed warnings on gcc-3.0.2 for G4DataVector.cc and
  G4PhysicsVector.cc.

- G4VInteractorManager::RemoveDispatcher : change the "std::remove"
  logic in order to fix a disfunctionning with vis/OpenInventor driver.

- Cleared compilation warnings on gcc-2.95.2.

source/materials				materials-V03-02-07
----------------

  type for ANSI compilers. Fixes compilation error on gcc-3.0.2.
  Modified files: G4Isotope.cc, G4Element.cc, G4Material.cc.

source/persistency				persistency-V03-02-02
------------------
- Added G4Pglobals.hh to G4PVHits and G4PVDigits to fix problem
  on gcc-2.95.2.

source/processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy	emlowen-V03-02-51
------------------------------------------
- Major physics improvement in electron processes.
  Significant improvement of performance
- New version of data G4EMLOW0.5 required.
- To reduce warnings increased majorant in delta-electron spectrum
  produced by electrons.

----------------------------------------
- Fixes for compilation on Windows/VC++.

source/processes/hadronic/management		man_had-V03-02-10
------------------------------------
- Bug fix in G4InelasticInteraction process.

source/processes/hadronic/models/chiral_inv_phase_space/interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------
						Chips-int-V03-02-00
- Fixed compilation errors on Windows/VC++ and removed debug
  statements.

source/processes/hadronic/models/generator/de_excitation
--------------------------------------------------------
						de_excitation-V03-02-01
- Fix for porting on gcc-3.0.2 in G4ExcitationHandler.cc: 
  use lists instead of vectors for storing fragments.

source/processes/hadronic/models/generator/pre_equilibrium
----------------------------------------------------------
						pre_eq-V03-02-02
- Fix for porting on gcc-3.0.2 in G4VPreCompoundFragment.cc

source/processes/hadronic/models/generator/quark_gluon_string
-------------------------------------------------------------
						qgs-V03-02-10

source/processes/hadronic/models/neutron_hp	neu-V03-02-06
-------------------------------------------
- Fix in G4NeutronHPVector.cc for the initialisation of 'theData'
  member in constructor.

source/processes/transportation			transport-V03-02-07
-------------------------------
- Activated the killing of 'looping' particles -- to be used also to
  abandon (kill) particles that are stuck (eg at boundaries).
- Fix for the new updating of the time for fields. It now keeps into
  account whether the field changes the energy (and therefore the
  velocity) in the field manager.

source/processes/GNUmakefile			processes-gmk-V03-02-02
----------------------------
- Removed duplicated entries.

----------
- Added rndmSaveThisRun() and rndmSaveThisEvent() methods to
  G4RunManager.
- Added /random/ commands to G4RunMessenger.
- G4RunManager.cc: fixed new date for the December public release.

  fCurrentStepNumber to 0.
- Modified G4ParticleChange::AddSecondary to correctly use
  touchable handle.

source/tracking					tracking-V03-02-05
---------------
- G4SteppingVerbose.cc: removed trigraph warning on Linux-g++.
- Correction to the use the touchable Handle for secondary tracks,
  when it is available. Now the direction is used in locating a
  particle (primary or secondary) in SetInitialStep(). This is in
  order to assist in starting particles that are on/near-to boundaries
  in the correct volume. 

source/visualization				vis-V03-02-21
--------------------
- Cleared most warnings on gcc-2.95.2.
- Moved G4FRSceneFunc.icc to include directory.
- Fixed pointer initialisation for porting on Windows/VC++ in
  G4VisCommandsSceneAdd.cc.

-------------------------------
- Fix for porting on Windows/VC++.

source/GNUmakefile				source-gmk-V03-02-03
------------------
- Removed "analysis" module.
- Fixed ../ path to $G4INSTALL

config						config-V03-02-15
------
- analysis.gmk: added flags to use an AIDA 2.2 compliant analysis
  system. 
- G4VIS_USE.gmk : -lG4HepRep replaced by -lG4visHepRep.
- architecture.gmk:
  o updated list of supported compilers
  o removed obsolete setup for STL ObjectSpace and STLport for
    Win/VC++.
- New version of the Configure script for installation.
- architecture.gmk:
  o updated list of supported compilers
  o removed obsolete setup for STL ObjectSpace and STLport for
    Win/VC++.
- binmake.gmk: activated mechanism for using $G4INCLUDE effectively for
  building examples/applications. Currently activated only for global
  compound libraries; for granular libraries it requires re-engineering
  of liblist, feature which will be added in future.
  This mechanism allows to considerably reduce the compilation/linking
  command length and the number of -I options fed to the compiler.
- Added G4PROFILE options to Linux-g++ and Linux-egcs setups.
- Removed binmake.EXTRALIBS.README, now part of User's Guide.
- Updated sources for Configure installation script.
