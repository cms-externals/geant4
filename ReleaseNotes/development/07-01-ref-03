                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Reviewed implementation of DistanceToIn/Out for G4Torus.
  o Fix to prohibit creation of ions in 'PreInit' state to make sure
    that proper processes will be attached to the ions.
  o Fix in elastic scattering for the case of target hydrogen in the
    low-energy hadronic model.
  o Fix in G4SteppingManager for the order of execution of
    'ExclusivelyForced' processes like Fast-Simulation.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

geometry/management                              geommng-V07-01-01
-------------------
- Added concrete implementation for GetPointOnSurface() to G4ReflectedSolid.

geometry/navigation                              geomnav-V07-01-01
-------------------
- G4DrawVoxels: removed unnecessary 'panic' message in
  ComputeVoxelPolyhedra() and some code cleanup.

geometry/solids/Boolean                          geom-bool-V07-01-00
-----------------------
- Added concrete implementation for GetPointOnSurface() to
  G4BooleanSolid and G4DisplacedSolid.
- Updated unit tests testG4DisplacedSolid and testG4IntersectionSolid.

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V07-01-02
-------------------
- Moved implementation for DistanceToIn/Out() in G4Torus to make use of
  G4JTPolynomialSolver for precise calculation of the intersections.
- Reviewed unit tests and reduced statistics.

global                                           global-V07-01-00
------
- G4UnitsTable.cc: added Surface/Mass unit (cm2/g).
- Added version.hh header, including definitions for software versioning.

particles                                        particles-V07-01-01
---------
- Fix to prohibit creation of ions in 'PreInit' state to make sure
  that proper processes will be attached to the ions.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V07-01-03
----------------------------------
- Fix for initialisation of G4eBremsstrahlungModel.
- Added G4MultipleScattering80 and G4MscModel80 development models.

processes/electromagnetic/xrays                  xrays-V07-01-01
-------------------------------
- Changed variable name 'MeanNumPhotons' to 'MeanNumberOfPhotons'
  in G4Scintillation and G4Cerenkov to conform with the documentation
  in the Application Developers Guide.

processes/hadronic/models/low_energy             ghad_low_en-V07-01-00
------------------------------------
- Fix in elastic scattering for the case of target hydrogen: use
  relativistic kinematic for the generation of the final state.
  Fix tested in HARP.

--------
- Fix in G4SteppingManager::DefinePhysicalStepLength() for the order
  of execution of 'ExclusivelyForced' processes like Fast-Simulation.
