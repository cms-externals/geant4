-------------------------------
- Updated G4VXTRenergyLoss and regular XTR radiators/models for more 
  accurate angular distribution of XTR.

processes/hadronic
------------------
- management (hadr-man-V09-05-00)
  o Moved isotope production infrastructure from process to model level;
    now done only for LEP models. Updated G4HadronicProcess accordingly.
  o G4IsoParticleChange: moved to models/management module.
- models/binary_cascade (had-binary-V09-04-14)
  o G4BinaryCascade, G4BinaryLightIonReaction, G4GeneratorPrecompoundInterface:
    added pointer to G4VPreCompoundModel in the constructor, for proper
    instantiation of G4PreCompoundModel.
  o Fixed minor leak in G4GeneratorPrecompoundInterface.
- models/cascade (hadr-casc-V09-05-04)
  o G4CascadeInterface: check for no-interaction in retryInelasticProton(),
    both in return value and in debugging report.
  o G4NucleiModel: in getPotential() added test for ip==9 (photon) to return
    zero potential. Return empty output (stop propagating) in case of particle
    collision.
  o G4ElementaryParticleCollider: added angular distributions for elastic and 
    inelastic 2-body final states of gamma p and gamma n reactions.
  o G4ElementaryParticle: expanded diagnostics in getMomModuleFor2toMany(),
    in generateSCMfinalState(), defer "particles.resize()" action until after
    final-state properties have been validated. In case no final state can be
    generated, this ensures that the failure propagates back up the calling
    chain, instead of simply looping forever.
  o G4PreCompoundDeexcitation: avoid deleting pre-compound model and
    excitation handler to avoid double deletion.
- models/chiral_inv_phase_space (hadr-chips-V09-05-00)
  o New tuning for stopping in CHIPS. Added rescattering to allow for wider
    energy resolution.

  o Fixed bug in G4AntiNuclElastic; introduced check of |cosTheta|<1.
- models/de_excitation (hadr-deex-V09-05-02)
  o G4ExcitationHandler: propagate G4VPhotonEvaporation pointer to
    G4Evaporation and do not delete it; this allows usin the same gamma 
    evaporation object inside G4Evaporation class and G4ExcitationHandler;
    added access methods to de-excitation components.
  o G4VEvaporationFactory, G4Evaporation, G4EvaporationGEMFactory,
    G4EvaporationFactory, G4EvaporationDefaultGEMFactory: proper deletion
    of decay channels after run. Simplified constructors.
  o G4Evaporation: cleanup logic of initialisation and setup options;
    always define photon evaporation channel as first; removed obsolete
    constructor
- models/inclxx (hadr-inclxx-V09-05-01)
  o Better (iterative) determination of the remnant recoil at the the end
    of the cascade. Isospin-dependent back-to-spectator.
  o Minor bug for negative incident pions: integration over impact-parameter
    distribution was incomplete.
  o Cache nuclear-density objects for better performance.
- models/isotope_production (hadr-isopro-V09-05-00)
  o Change GetIsotope() interface argument to use G4HadProjectile instead 
    of G4Track. Classes affected: G4NeutronIsotopeProduction and
    G4ProtonIsotopeProduction.
- models/lend (hadr-lend-V09-05-00)                                          (*)
  o Fixed compilation warnings on Ubuntu; cleanup of header files inclusion.
- models/low_energy (hadr-lep-V09-05-00)
  o Moved G4InelasticInteraction class to this module from 'management'. 
  o In ApplyYourself() method of all G4LEXXXInelastic classes, added call
    to DoIsotopeCounting(), conditional upon isotope production mode being
    turned on.
- models/management (hadr-modman-V09-04-05)
  o Moved G4InelasticInteraction class to 'low_energy' model.
  o G4IsoParticleChange: moved from main 'management' module; removed Set
    and GetProductionPosition() methods, and changed Set and
    GetParentParticle() argument from G4DynamicParticle to G4ParticleDefinition.
  o G4VIsotopeProduction: replace G4Track argument in GetIsotope() with 
    G4HadProjectile.
  o G4VHighEnergyGenerator: added virtual method PartonStringModelDescription().
  o G4VIntraNuclearTransportModel, G4VPreCompoundModel: cleanup for objec
    construction/deletion.
- models/neutron_hp (hadr-hpn-V09-05-00)                                     (*)
  o Fixed warning message in G4NeutronHPInelastic.
- models/photolepton_hadron/muon_nuclear (hadr-munuclear-V09-05-00)
  o Modified base class for G4VDMuonNuclearModel to be G4HadronicInteraction
    instead of G4InelasticInteraction.
- models/pre_equilibrium (hadr-pre-V09-05-00)
  o G4PreCompoundModel: properly deal with instantiation and deletion of
    G4ExcitationHandler in constructor and destructor.
- stopping (hadr-stopping-V09-05-01)
  o G4FTFCaptureAtRest: modified initialisation of de-excitation; fixed
    potential cases of double deletion of objects; added registration
    in G4HadronicProcessStore and added sub-type definition.
  o G4PiMinusAbsorptionBertini: temporarily use Bertini pre-compound instead
    of native pre-compound.

-----------------
- G4OpBoundaryProcess: call ProposeVelocity() for particle-change at every
  invocation of DoIt(); for Fresnel refraction calculate final velocity
  locally.  Addressing problem report #1275.

run                                              run-V09-05-00               (*)

-------------
- management:
  o G4VisManager::EndOfEvent: removed unwarranted DrawView().
    It was causing two copies of the geometry to be drawn.
  o G4VisManager: implemented Begin/EndDraw(2D).
    This forces all thus-bracketed Draw messages to have the same
    transformation. If an attempt to change the transformation is detected,
    a fatal exception is raised.
  o G4VSceneHandler: Added Get/SetObjectTransformation.
  o Marker size bug fix.
- modeling:
  o Validating geometry in all worlds.
  o Use Begin/EndDraw to improve drawing speed. Assumes all trajectories
    are drawn with the same transformation.
- OpenGL:

  o Significant rationalisation in G4OpenGLSceneHandler.
  o Removed #ifdef G4VIS... protection from header files.
- OpenInventor:
  o Removed #ifdef G4VIS... protection from header files.
- Tree (vistree-V09-05-00)
  o G4VTreeSceneHandler: removed empty implementations of Begin/EndPrimitives(),
    which allows objects to pick up the default (and correct non-empty default
    implementations in G4VSceneHandler).
- XXX:
  o Removed #ifdef ...XXXSG... protections.
