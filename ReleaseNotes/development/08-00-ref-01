---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Tags marked with (*) are also included in patch-01.

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

digits_hits                                      digits_hits-V08-00-00 (*)
-----------
- Added missing methods in G4VDigiCollection and G4TDigiCollection.

geometry/divisions                               geomdiv-V08-00-00 (*)
------------------
- Added missing setting of mother-logical pointer in constructors of
  G4PVDivision. Fixes problem report #829.
- Added checks for illegal constructs of G4PVDivision (NULL pointer to
  mother logical and self-placement).
- Fixed check for generic construct in G4ParameterisationPolycone and
  G4ParameterisationPolyhedra: allow it for the automatic replicated instance.

geometry/solids/BREPS                            breps-V08-00-00 (*)
---------------------
- Use explicit 'HepGeom' namespace for 'Identity', to allow for porting
  on Windows/VC++ when using CLHEP-2.0.X.

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V08-00-00 (*)
-------------------
- G4Sphere: fixed bug in DistanceToOut() for theta intersections.
  Fixes bug report #830.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V08-00-01 (*)
------------------------
- Fixes in G4EllipticalCone:
  o Changed GetPointOnSurface(), which was not uniform in endcaps.
  o Bug fix in Inside(), which was not correct for the elliptic mantel.
    Made test similar as in G4EllipticTube.
  o Several fixes in DistanceToIn/Out(): for looping events (shortest
    distance was taken, even if 0); now comparing the distance to the endcap
    and to the mantel and decide afterwards which distance is shortest;
    added check n*v.
  o The code is now "good" at 90%. Still 10% wrong reconstructed events.
    e.g there is a problem is DistanceToOut(): missed the intersection
    (reconstruction took the encap instead of the mantel).
- Fixed visibility of soft edges on the twisted solids.
- G4TwistedTubs and G4VTwistedFaceted::CreatePolyhedron():
  parameterised polyhedron mesh approximation in terms of
  G4Polyhedron::GetNumberOfRotationSteps().
  This is (a) more economical and (b) amenable to user control.
