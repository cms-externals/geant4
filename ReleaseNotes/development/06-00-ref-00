                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o New hadronic_lists module for hadronic physics lists by use case.
    The module can only be built and installed separately in addition
    to the standard libraries installation.
  o Includes validation of hadronic physics for release 6.0.
  o In environments: new version of MOMO with XML import/export abilities.
  o Introduced G4SurfaceProperty base class for materials and adapted
    G4LogicalSurface and G4OpticalSurface to use the new generic interface.
  o Revision of advanced and extended examples.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

geometry/management                     geommng-V05-02-05
-------------------
- G4LogicalSurface: modified to use generic G4SurfaceProperty
  instead of G4OpticalSurface.

geometry/navigation                     geomnav-V05-02-15
-------------------
- G4PropagatorInField:
  o Added argument to method LocateIntersectionPoint(G4bool& recalculatedEndPt)
    to return 'true' if the endpoint has been recalculated.
    This fixes a problem that can occasionally cause the skipping of a volume
    boundary - in the case when a re-integration was done near a boundary.
  o ComputeStep() also changed to accept above recalculation.
  o New method GetVerboseLevel(), closer to std naming than Verbose()
  o Fixed LocateIntersectionPoint() for long-standing error.
    A section of the chord was not considered in use case where
    a previous chord at first appeared to have an intersection, but did not.
    Refined re-setting of finalSection (Endpoint recalculation is returned
    only for final section).
  o Fixed ReEstimateEndPoint() which ignored return code of AccurateAdvance()
    and moved to short end-point for long requests.
    It now leaves the endpoint unchanged, when it cannot improve it.
  o Corrected placement of #endif for an #ifdef VERBOSE.
- G4TransportationManager:
  o removed initialisation of allocators for navigation levels, where they
    were introduced as workaround for solving static initialisation a long
    time ago. Now moved to "volumes" module, where they should belong, in
    G4TouchableHistory.
- Restored original unit-tests, using inherited navigator.

geometry/solids/Boolean                 geombool-V05-02-04
-----------------------
- G4ReflectedSolid: fixed trivial leak in constructor.

geometry/solids/CSG                     geom-csg-V05-02-05
-------------------
- G4Trap: fixed initialisation of planes in default constructor.
- Added new unit test for G4Sphere and new test case for G4Cons.

geometry/solids/tests                   geom-solids-tests-V05-02-00
---------------------
- Brought up-to-date SBT unit test.

geometry/volumes                        geomvol-V05-02-08
----------------
- G4TouchableHistory: added initialisation of allocators for navigation
  levels, moved from G4TransportationManager, where they were introduced
  as workaround for solving static initialisation a long time ago.
- G4NavigationHistory: fixed redundant calls and initialisations.
- G4NavigationLevel, G4NavigationLevelRep: fixed implementation of
  operator=() for inlining.
- G4LogicalBorderSurface, G4LogicalSkinSurface:
  o modified to use generic G4SurfaceProperty instead of G4OpticalSurface.
- Updated unit tests to use inherited navigator.
