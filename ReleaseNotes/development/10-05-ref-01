visualization                                    vis-V10-05-06
-------------
- management:
  o Include parameterised volumes in overlap checking and visualisation
    in G4LogicalVolumeModel (in addition to ordinary placements).

    Reset with "/vis/viewer/reset".
  o Rationalised view interpolation; encapsulate algorithm into base class
    G4VVisCommand, so that commands "/vis/viewer/interpolate",
    "/vis/viewer/centreOn" and "/vis/touchable/centerOn" now use this.
    Might consider use by all view changing commands.
  o Pick up default number of line-segments-per-circle from G4Polyhedron.    (o)
  o Improved guidance for "/vis/scene/add/volume".
  o Minor improvements to visualization manager.
- modeling:
  o Added volume count (but commented out printing).
