  o Rewritten code for delta phi >= 2*PI case with full classification of
    possible cases. 
  o Fixed sense of end planes.

    fix #266. 
  o Added new private method for creation of planar surfaces gained 
    after code refactoring in constructor. 
  o Fixed bug for problem report #354 by adding the code handling the
    cases where user supplies for the same z-section different RMIN or
    RMAX values.
  o Added more preconditions checks 
  o Added code forbidding "teeth" in polyhedra.
- G4ConvexHull.hh: moved initialisation of 'next' to constructor's body.

-----------------------------
- G4RepresentationRelationshipCreator.cc: fixed unsafe usage of '<' operator. 

interfaces			interfaces-V04-00-00
----------
- Fixed for odd behavior of G4UIcsh in Windows systems.

materials			materials-V04-00-01
---------
- Optimised implementation of GetIndex() for fIndexTable in G4Material,
  G4Element and G4Isotope.

particles			particles-V04-00-00
---------
- Fixed bug in the decay table for G4KaonMinus.

processes/decay			decay-V04-00-01
---------------
- Removed a physics table from G4Decay.

processes/electromagnetic/muons			muons-V04-00-00
-------------------------------

  o Adopt MinDeltaCut in-range instead of in-energy !

processes/electromagnetic/utils			utils-V04-00-02
-------------------------------
- G4VEnergyLoss:
  o Set subSecFlag to false. NO default subcutoff generation.
  o Set finalRange to 1mm as default (the actual value is computed in
    G4VeEnergyLoss, G4VhEnergyLoss and G4VMuEnergyLoss).

processes/hadronic/models/generator	pre_eq-V03-03-00, hadgen-util-V04-00-00,
-----------------------------------     de_excitation-V03-03-00
- Fixes in pre-equilibrium and de-excitation generator models.
- Optimised implementation in G4Fancy3DNucleus.cc to allow porting on
  WIN32-VC for optimised compilation. 

processes/hadronic/models/chiral_inv_phase_space/body	chips-body-V04-00-01
-----------------------------------------------------
- CHIPS model: fixed accuracy problem.

processes/hadronic/models/neutron_hp	neu-V04-00-00
------------------------------------
- Fixed bug in doppler broadening in neutron-transport model:
  o Fixed sign error in calculation of effective luminosity.

processes/hadronic/stopping		stop-V04-00-00
---------------------------
- Stopping: trivial bug-fix in pi-absorption at rest. 

processes/hadronic/utils		had_util-V04-00-01
------------------------
- Trivial bug-fix, affecting K-absorption at rest.
- G4Nucleus: moved definition of constructors/destructor from header to
  source implementation file. Unresolved symbols were detected at link
  time on SUN-CC for static constants used to initialise members in
  inline constructors. 

track				track-V04-00-02
-----
- Added G4Track::CopyTrackInfo().
- Optimised G4ParticleChange::AddSecondary() to properly use touchable
  handles.
- Fixed a bug of changing parent weight in
  G4ParticleChange::UpdateStepForAlongStep().
- Optimised implementation in G4Track::GetVelocity().
- Removed event biasing mechanism from track category (now moved to
  hadronic/models).

tracking			tracking-V04-00-04
--------
- G4SteppingManager2.cc:
  o fix for extra steps when the ApplyCuts flag is set 
  o G4SteppingManager.hh: changed scope for 'SizeOfSelectedDoItVector'
    to allow porting on WIN-VC compiler.
- Fix in G4SteppingManager::SetInitialStep() for applyCuts. 

visualization			vis-V04-00-02
-------------
- HepRep: added check for missing hierarchy layers in HepRepXMLWriter. 
- Bug fix in modeling: removed Begin/EndPrimitives from G4HitsModel and
  G4TrajectoriesModel. This was causing nested calls to Begin/EndPrimitives
  (and thus to glNewList/EndList in OpenGL stored mode), since the
  trajectories and hits Draw methods themselves have Begin/EndPrimitives.

examples			examples-V04-00-01
--------
- extended/electromagnetic/testem1,3,4,5:
  o Improvements in PrimaryGenerator and macros.
- novice/N03:
  o New macros for tutorials/exercises.
- Updated reference outputs.

tests                           tests-V04-00-01
-----
- Updated reference outputs.
