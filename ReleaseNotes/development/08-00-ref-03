-------------
- management
  o Added /vis/scene/transientsAction.  The default is "rerun", i.e.,
    when the viewer requests, the previous event or run will be processed
    again with the original random number seed so that transients
    (trajectories, hits, user drawing, etc.) are reconstructed.  Thus,
    transients are "remembered" and may be copied between graphics systems.
    Can be turned off with "/vis/scene/transientsAction none".
  o Introduced /vis/geometry/* commands for editing vis attributes of
    geometry volumes.
  o First implementation of refresh end-of-event.
  o Fixes for recomputation of transients when changing drivers.
