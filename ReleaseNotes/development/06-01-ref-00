digits_hits                                      digits_hits-V06-00-01
-----------
- Added methods to G4HCtable for additional verbosity.

event                                            events-V06-00-01
-----
- LocateGlobalPointAndSetup() method of G4Navigator is now invoked at the
  beginning of each new event to reset the navigation history.

  of the local point in the calculation of a valid exit normal.
- Added "check_mode" state for navigators. The state can be activated by
  a new UI command (geometry/navigator/check_mode [true/false]) and will
  force more strict and less tolerant checks in step/safety computation to
  verify the correctness of solids' response in the geometry.
- Reorganised verbosity levels. Added more useful information activated
  when in G4VERBOSE mode and verbosity level selected.
  Fixed output formatting when entering/exiting verbose blocks.
