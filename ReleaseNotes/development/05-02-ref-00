                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Removed obsolete 'g4std' wrappers and definition of G4std.
    Migrated code to standard C++ calls to std namespace and STL headers.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

global code migration
---------------------
** Replaced usage of G4std:: with std::
** Replaced statements:
     #include "g4std/XXX"
   with:
     #include <XXX>

config                                  config-V05-01-05
------
- architecture.gmk, binmake.gmk:
  o added flags G4LIB_BUILD_STEP/G4USE_STEP to make optional the compilation
    of the STEP library and interface module.
    By default the libraries will not be built.
- architecture.gmk and specific setups in sys:
  o get rid of G4_HAVE_BOOL macro. Now using default 'bool' type,
    defined in all supported compilers.
  o Removed flag G4USE_STD_NAMESPACE from specific setups in sys.
    Follows migration from G4std apported in source/global and whole code.
- G4VIS_BUILD.gmk, G4VIS_USE.gmk, G4UI_BUILD.gmk, G4UI_USE.gmk, and
  sys/{Linux-g++,SUN-CC}.gmk:
  o When building shared libraries needing external libs like OpenGL...,
    add these at shared library building, so these libs know about their
    dependencies and have these resolved.
- Added UI32LIBS to interactivity.gmk to handle UI libraries on WIN32
  platforms.
- Added libraries for OpenGL and UI to default setup of WIN32-VC and
  WIN32-VC7. Removed some obsolete compilation options.

geometry/magneticfield                  field-V05-01-06
----------------------
- G4FieldManager:
  o Revised into 'slightly' abstract class with one (new) virtual method:
      ConfigureForTrack( const G4Track *)
    to enable the user to configure it with different accuracy parameters
    depending on energy, particle id, volume, or other track state.
- G4ChordFinder:
  o Minor revision of interfaces:
    - FindNextChord() now provides next Step estimate (for accuracy
      in Integration)
    - AdvanceChordLimited() to use FindNextChord() and initial-step.
  o Fix to initialise several member data in simple constructor
  o Fixed unitialised variable for next step (now used for optimisation).
  o Protected assignment of fLastStepEstimate_Unconstrained in case of
    unitialised value.
- G4MagIntegratorDriver:
  o Keep simple statistics on number of steps, total error and step size.
  o Took out unneccessary square roots and two divisions.
    Giving 15% performance boost.
  o Added extra argument for suggested initial step size 'hinitial' to
    Accurate Advance.

geometry/solids                         geomsolids-V05-01-00

+ Made compilation of STEP and STEPinterface modules optional
  controlled by variable G4LIB_BUILD_STEP/G4USE_STEP. By default modules
  are not built.
+ Boolean (geom-bool-V05-01-02)
  -------
  - G4ReflectionFactory:
    o Made public accessors: GetConstituentLV(), GetReflectedLV(),
      IsConstituent() and IsReflected().
    o Added accessor GetReflectedVolumesMap() to access list of
      reflected volumes.
+ CSG (geom-csg-V05-01-00)
  ---
  - Updated disclaimer to unit test.
+ BREPS (breps-V05-01-01)
  -----
  - Fixes for inclusion of <strstream> in G4BREPSolidPCone.cc in view
    of the g4std wrappers migration.
+ STEP (STEP-V05-01-00)
  ----
  - STEPattribute.h: commented unused definition of 'real' since clashing
    with system headers.
  - STEPattribute.cc, sdaiString.cc: removed usage of G4USE_STD_NAMESPACE
    macro, according to migration from g4std wrappers.

geometry/volumes                        geomvol-V05-01-04
----------------
- G4PropagatorInField:
  o Implemented use of safety to reduce calls to navigator.
  o Changed the default value of "maximum step count" from 10000 to 1000.
    This will cause more particles to be recognised to loop earlier as this
    parameter controls this behavior too.
  o Added new method FindAndSetFieldManager() to find the current field
    manager and set it for the Propagator.  The class currently ensures
    that this method is always called once for each call to ComputeStep().
  o Added new method SetDetectorFieldManager(), so as to have it updated
    when the global field manager is changed.
- G4TransportationManager: corrected the method SetFieldManager().
  It now messages the current global PropagatorInField to notify it.

  values.
