                       ===================

Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last
recommended reference tag are:
    - updated most headers in the geometry module for comments to be
      included in the Software Reference Manual.
      Fixes to magnetic-field and solids/CSG modules.
    - Fixed configuration problem in persistency module.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the full list of changes is the following:

config
------
- Implemented modular setup. Now system specific configurations are 
  grouped in separated files $G4SYSTEM.gmk and placed in the new 
  directory config/sys. 

electromagnetic processes
-------------------------
- Low-energies processes:
  o fixes in G4LowEnergyBremsstrahlung for continuous energy loss.

geometry
--------
- Magnetic Field: 
  o fixes to G4MagErrorStepper (check on chord endpoint), 
    G4RKG3_Stepper (deleted error message from StepNoErr), 
    G4MagIntegratorDriver (modified debug information). 
  o minor fix to dummy implementation of assignment operator 
    in G4MagneticField.hh. 
  o modified method for finding new trial step in G4ChordFinder. 
- Volumes:
  o introduced kCarTolerance for check over taken step length and 
    TruePathLength in G4PropagatorInField::ComputeStep(). 
- CSG Solids:
  o fixes in DistanceToIn(p,v) for G4Box and G4Trd to return zero
    distance in case computed value is less than 0.5*kCarTolerance.
  o fix to G4Tubs::DistanceToOut(p,v,...) in computation of xi, yi
    for (sphi>=-0.5*kCarTolerance). Fixes problem reports #76 and #91. 
  o added more diagnostics in case of invalid enum for DistanceToOut.
- Boolean Solids:
  o temporarily disabled CreatePolyhedron() by forcing return of NULL
    pointer. Therefore, visualization of Boolean solids is temporarily
    disabled, pending definitive fix in graphics_reps BooleanProcessor.
- Changed comments to headers for the Software Reference Manual in
  management, volumes, magnetic-field, CSG/Boolean modules.
  Removed obsolete file G4Transform.hh.

graphics representations
------------------------
- Minor fix to HepPolyhedron code for ISO/ANSI compliance.

visualization
-------------
- Added command /vis/viewer/reset. 
- G4VViewer: added method GetShortName(), corrected SetName(...). 
- G4ViewParameters.hh: improved class description. 
- G4VisManager: added ViewerShortName(...) and GetViewer(...) utilities. 
- G4RayTracer: set out-of-world ray to black. 
- G4RayTracerViewer: corrected trapping of orthogonal projection.
