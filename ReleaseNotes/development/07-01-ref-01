                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Introduced support for nested parameterisations in geometry with ability
    to use parent information to compute/change material.
  o Added new specific shape G4Ellipsoid.
  o Added protection against negative numbers in G4UniversalFluctuation
    and fixes in chemical formula for G4BraggModel and G4BraggIonModel.
  o Memory leak fix for nuclear mass management in CHIPS.


---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V07-01-00
------
- Excluded usage of unnecessary 'ranlib' at creation of the libraries for
  WIN32-VC system. Fixes an observed problem of debug-symbols corruption.

geometry/navigation                              geomnav-V07-01-00
-------------------
- Added ability to use nested parameterisations to parameterised navigation.

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V07-01-00
-------------------
- Fixed bug in G4Sphere::DistanceToOut(p,v):
  added check for intersection with double cone.
- Added new unit test testDistanceAccuracy.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V07-01-01
------------------------
- Added new shape G4Ellipsoid. Contribution of G.Horton-Smith and G.Guerrieri.
  Code cleanup, and added default arguments for cuts, added first
  implementation of unit test.
- Fixed compilation warning on WIN32-VC for G4VSurface.cc.
- Corrected unit tests for twisted-box/trap.

geometry/solids/test                             geom-solids-tests-V07-01-00
--------------------
- Added new test SurfaceCheck.

geometry/volumes                                 geomvol-V07-01-00
----------------
- Added G4VNestedParameterisation class with ability to use parent
  information to compute/change material.
  Added G4PhysicalTouchable class to enable this type of parameterisation.
  This class is an implementation class only, and its name especially
  and potentially other aspect is/are likely to be changed.
  A revision of the interface of G4VPVParamerisation can provide this
  capability in future, in a simpler way.

graphics_reps                                    greps-V07-01-00
-------------
- Added Polyhedron description for new G4Ellipsoid shape.

processes/electromagnetic/highenergy             emhighenergy-V07-01-00
------------------------------------
- Fixed a misprint in G4BetheBlochNoDeltaModel.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V07-01-01
----------------------------------
- Added protection against negative numbers in G4UniversalFluctuation.
- Increased number of bins for internal table to 200 in G4BetheHeitlerModel.
- Fixes in chemical formula for G4BraggModel and G4BraggIonModel.
- Added extra protection in sampling of recoil direction of e+ in
  G4MollerBHaBHaModel.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V07-01-00

- Fix in G4VEnergyLossProcess: added protection against zero energy post
  step in non-integral mode.
- Removed inlined constructors and destructors in G4VEmModel and
  G4VEmFluctuationModel.
- G4VEmProcess: use integral mode only for charged particles.

processes/hadronic/models/chiral.../body         ghad-chips-body-V07-01-00
----------------------------------------
- Memory leak fix for nuclear mass management in G4QPDGCode to use
  G4 masses of nuclear fragments.
