                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Enhanced commands in G4GeometryMessenger for controlling geometry
    overlaps: added possibility to control recursion depth and resolution
    of the test.
  o Standardised registration/deregistration mechanism for physical volumes,
    fixed incorrect behavior in deregistration of daughters in G4LogicalVolume
    when physical volumes are explicitely deleted.
  o Improved design on EM low-energy module to allow for multiple models
    of Bremsstrahlung angular distribution. Updated data-set to version 2.2.
  o Important fix in MultipleScattering algorithms: fixed angle
    distribution for muons/hadrons to have the distribution width to
    correspond to the value from the HighLand formula.
