                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Fixed bug in G4ProductionCutsTable for the update of materials/cuts
    couple for dynamic setups where material may vary, like in the case
    of parameterization of detectors through material.
  o Added caching mechanism for G4Polyhedron in physical volumes.
  o Added new standard EM model G4BraggIonModel for ion ionization
    and new process and model classes for e+ annihilation to pi+pi-.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

geometry                                         geometry-V06-02-00
--------
- management (geommng-V06-02-03)
  o Added map for storage of materials/cuts to G4Region, and added methods
    for handling registration of couples in the map, finding a couple
    according to a given material, clearing the map's storage.
  o Added method UpdateMaterial() to G4LogicalVolume to refresh a material/cut
    couple in the corresponding region.
  o Added GetPolyhedron() to G4VPhysicalVolume, a smart access function that
    creates a G4Polyhedron on request and stores for future access. A null
    pointer means "not available".
- navigation (geomnav-V06-02-04)
  o Invoke G4LogicalVolume::UpdateMaterial() instead of SetMaterial() for
    parameterised navigation in G4Navigator and G4ParameterisedNavigation
- solids (geom-bool-V06-02-01, breps-V06-02-02,
          geom-csg-V06-02-05, geom-specific-V06-02-01)
  o Added specific GetPolyhedron() to solids, a smart access function that
    creates a G4Polyhedron on request and stores for future access. A null
    pointer means "not available".

------
- Added collection of flags and related methods in G4PhysicsTable.

-----------------
- Fixed bug in G4PlaneVectorRand and resampled theFacetNormal for
  LobeReflection in DielectricMetal.
- Fixed bug in DielectricMetal only GetFacetNormal() for LobeReflection.
- Migrated processes to new interface for G4VParticleChange.
- Added G4OPTICAL_DEBUG flag to control debug printouts and checks.
