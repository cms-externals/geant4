---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                  config-V04-00-06
------

  with GNU g++ compiler.

event                                   event-V04-00-02
-----
- Introducing new G4TrajectoryContainer class which aggregates STL vector,
  instead of deriving from STL vector.

geometry/magneticfield                  field-V04-00-02
----------------------
- G4MagIntegratorDriver: fix to update the field track for steps smaller
  than the chord finder's minstep. 
- Fixed LinearStep in G4MagHelicalStepper (expected unit direction), 
  that had not been updated for new integration variable (momentum).
- Changed maximum number of steps in driver, 
    halving from 500/order to 250/order.
- Added new unit test "OtherField" with application of Delphi, Quadropole...
  fields. Updated unit tests reference outputs.
- Update of unit test field02 to utilise new features:
  o for Electric Field, to signal that a field modifies the energy
  o updating of time by integration, for time dependent fields

geometry/management                     geommng-V04-00-06
-------------------
- G4VSolid: use polygon clipping for limited voxel when != pAxis.
- G4GeometryManager:
  o added method IsGeometryClosed() for detecting status (open/closed)
    of geometry.
- G4LogicalVolumeStore, G4PhysicalVolumeStore, G4SolidStore:
  o added protection to Clean() method for checking if geometry is closed.
- G4SmartVoxelHeader:
  o added utility method GetParamAxis() to retrieve suggested axis for
    optimisation of parametrised geometry
  o enhanced BuildReplicaVoxels() to apply 3D voxelisation for non-consuming
    nodes if undefined axis ('kUndefined') is specified for parametrised
    volumes. In such case, optimisation for parameterised volumes is applied
    similarly to normal placements
  o cosmetics and formatting cleanup
- G4PVReplica.cc:
  o deal with 'kUndefined' EAxis
- Added ability to optionally optimise/non-optimise detector regions
  using logical volumes:
  o G4LogicalVolume:
    - Introduced additional bool argument to constructor,
      set to 'true' by default.
    - Added method IsToOptimise() with corresponding bool flag attribute.
  o G4GeometryManager:
    - Adapted BuildOptimisations() method to consider optional optimisation
      flag from G4LogicalVolume.

geometry/volumes                        geomvol-V04-00-07
----------------
- G4ParameterisedNavigation:
  o introduced 3D voxelisation technique for parameterised volumes with
    unspecified axis. Changed to become subclass of G4VoxelNavigation and
    adopt the same voxel location algorithms for optimised navigation
- G4VoxelNavigation:
  o changed to become base class for optimised navigation
  o cosmetics and reformatting
- G4NormalNavigation.icc, G4ReplicaNavigation.icc, G4VoxelNavigation.icc:
  o minor optimisations
  o cosmetics and reformatting
- G4Navigator.cc:
  o invoke specific VoxelLocate() call for parameterised navigation

geometry/solids/Boolean                 geom-bool-V04-00-05
-----------------------
- G4ReflectedSolid.cc:
  o adopt bounding-box like algorithm for CalculateExtent().

geometry/solids/CSG                     geom-csg-V04-00-04
-------------------
- G4Trap.cc, G4Tubs.cc:
  o changed local enum 'kUndefined' to 'kUndef'.
    'kUndefined' is now defined for EAxis.

geometry/solids/specific                geom-solids-specific-V04-00-01
------------------------
- Implemented G4EllipticalTube::CreatePolyhedron().

global                                  global-V04-00-07
------
- Introduced temporary modifications for porting on gcc-3.1 compiler:
  o g4std/strstream: deactivate gcc-3.1 specific __DEPRECATED flag.
  o G4strstreambuf.icc: correct patch for overflow() to be specific only to
    gcc-3.0.X versions of the compiler. Behavior now fixed in gcc-3.1.
  o G4llocator.hh: use pointer to member data to compute offset in FreeSingle().
    for gcc-3.1 compiler. gcc-3.1 complains and does not correctly handle
    offsets computed from non-POD types. Pointers to member data should be
    used instead. This advanced C++ feature seems not to work on earlier
    versions of the same compiler or on other system configurations.
- Cosmetics for Software Reference Manual on G4Allocator related headers.
- G4UnitsTable.cc: fixed bug in operator<< to use the argument 'flux'
  instead of G4cout.
- geomdefs.hh: added 'kUndefined' key to specify undefined EAxis.

- G4Scintillation:
  o change inheritance from G4VRestDiscreteProcess. G4Scintillation/G4Cerenkov
    now only suspend the track when it is still 'fAlive'
  o changed method DoIt() so that origin of optical photons is the
    PostStepPoint location in case energy is lost to the medium by a neutral
    particle.
  o changed method IsApplicable() to return false when it is called for an
    optical photon.
