cmake                                            cmake-V11-01-07
-----
- Removed no longer required G4VecGeomShim module.                        (o)(*)
  VecGeom supports/supplies full imported targets since 1.1.18
  Use of VECGEOM_LIBRARIES variable required to allow build against
  CUDA-enabled VecGeom.
- Updated Qt MOC application for G4UI implementation in place of
  G4UIbasic/G4UIcommon.
- Streamlined VTK cmake components.
- Updated to dataset G4EMLOW-8.3.

config                                           config-V11-01-00
------
- Updated UI/interfaces include paths to reflect new organization.

global                                           global-V11-01-06
------
- Removed obsolete and no longer used G4SIunits.hh header.
- Updated date and tag-ID for geant4-11-01-ref-02.

interfaces                                       interfaces-V11-01-08
----------
- Refactored modules into G4UIcore and G4UIimplementation to isolate
  core/always on functionality from concrete UIs requiring external libraries.
  Both modules are still built into a G4interfaces library, with no change to
  user interface for applications. 
- Applied clang-tidy and clang-format fixes, together with
  public/protected/private ordering in headers.
- G4UIQt: fixed mutex bug in implementation of G4UIQt::ReceiveG4debug();
  moved "workaround output" (std::cout) under control of mutex;
  limit "workaround output" to master thread.
  Use the same mutex for all 3 output streams.
  This "workaround" is to make sure all flushed output appears on the terminal
  after a crash, because even flushed output can get lost in the Qt UI system.
  Move "smart warning" code outside mutex lock to avoid double locking.
- In G4UIQt, replaced use of G4int by int in QT signal/slots.

materials                                        materials-V11-01-02
---------

  specifiers and docstrings; applied clang-format.

particles                                        particles-V11-01-03
---------

  in PDG-2022.
- G4(Anti)OmegacZero: updated mean life time.                             (o)(*)
