                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included are:

  o Critical fix to G4AuxiliaryNavServices, to avoid erroneous
    condition frequently occurring in the new usage of Locate with
    direction to initialise a step.  
  o Fix in G4Navigator to properly reset blocked volume when
    locating 'within volume'.
  o Fix in G4strstreambuf to properly handling flushing of buffer
    in gcc-3.X compilers.
  o Added check for primary track outside of the world in
    G4SteppingManager.
  o Fix in HepRepXMLWriter for correctly handling of already open
    files.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config				config-V04-00-00
------
- HP-aCC.gmk: removed include path to obsolete std wrappers.

event				event-V04-00-00
-----
- G4PrimaryTransformer: removed check whether the primary vertex is
  inside the world volume. The check has been moved to G4SteppingManager.

geometry			geometry-V04-00-00
--------
- magnetic field:
  o Activated G4DEBUG_FIELD in GNUmakefile.
  o G4MagHelicalStepper.cc: renamed local variables "*Momentum*"
    to "*Velocity*". 
- management:
  o G4AffineTransform.icc: fixed trivial compilation warning for gcc-2.95.2.
- volumes:			geomvol-V04-00-02
  o G4AuxiliaryNavServices: critical fix, to only consider whether a
    'ray' (Point,Direction) is on the surface (it was erroneously also
    checking for those inside volumes). This erroneous condition occurred
    frequently in the new usage of Locate with Direction to initialise a
    step.  
  o G4Navigator: reset blocked volume when locating 'within volume',
    after ensuring that it does not get called when ComputeSafety() is at
    a boundary. Fixes cases of longstanding 'Point P is Inside' errors.
  o Activated mechanism in GNUmakefile for allowing compilation with
    G4DEBUG_FIELD or G4DEBUG_NAVIGATION flags.
- solids/Boolean:
  o Moved all verbosity mode warnings to G4BOOLDEBUG.
  o Activated G4BOOLDEBUG mechanism in GNUmakefile.
- solids/BREPS:
  o G4BREPSolidPCone: bugfix for problem report #320.
    Fixed missing use-case in constructor when RMAX and RMIN have been
    changed for 2 consecutive equal z-values. Now it creates correctly
    2 planar surfaces as expected.
    Added private method ComputePlanarSurface() gained
    by refactoring of some part of the code in the constructor.
  o G4FPlane: fixed first constructor adding new argument for setting
    explicitly the sense of a surface if required.
    Fixed G4FPlane::Intersect() method which incorrectly ignored a special
    case of a hit on surface point with ray direction opposite to surface
    normal.
- solids/CSG:
  o G4Sphere.cc: fixed a problem with tolerances in the case of large Radius.
  o Moved all verbosity mode warnings to G4CSGDEBUG.
  o Activated G4CSGDEBUG mechanism in GNUmakefile.

global				global-V04-00-02
------
- G4strstreambuf: plugged memory leak in destructor for buffer deletion.
  Temporary fix to G4strstream::overflow(c) for GNU gcc-3.X compilers
  (also problem report #342), which require returning of character 'c' in
  case of buffer flushing for <CR>.
- Replaced 'NULL' with '0' in G4Allocator.hh, G4strstreambuf.icc
  and G4Timer.cc.
- Removed obsolete inline definitions in g4std/wrappers/DEC-cxx/cmath.
- Removed obsolete wrappers files for HP-aCC in g4std/wrappers.

track				track-V04-00-00
-----
- G4Track: corrected initialization of fStepLength in constructors.
  Fixed bug in assignment operator for fStepLength.

tracking			tracking-V04-00-02
--------
- G4SteppingManager:
  o fix safe comparison between floating numbers
  o added check for primary track outside of the world
  o bug fix for particles below threshold to avoid double steps

visualization			vis-V03-02-22
-------------
- Corrected handling for already open file in HepRepXMLWriter.

examples			examples-V04-00-00
--------
- Novice: syncronised files with CVS HEAD. No functional changes to code.
- Updated reference outputs.

tests				tests-V04-00-00
-----
- Updated reference outputs.
