materials                                        materials-V09-02-01
---------
- Implemented migration of ICRU 73 stopping power classes to the
  G4VIonDEDXTable interface:
  o Access methods of physics vectors have changed (vectors can also be
    identified via atomic number of material if material is pure);
  o Classes now deliver mass stopping powers instead of stopping powers per
    unit length
  o Any dependency on ICRU 73 material densities was removed (no densities
    are included in the classes anymore).
  o Stopping power vectors are now only built on request and not anymore in
    the constructor.
  o Affected classes: G4IronStoppingICRU73, G4MaterialStoppingICRU73 and
    G4SimpleMaterialStoppingICRU73.
- G4VIonDEDXTable: added interface class for electronic stopping power
  tables for ions.
- G4ExternalDEDXTable: added utility class to handle external electronic
  stopping power tables for ions.

----------------
- Fixed association of entities in nested loops for solids and materials.    (*)
  Definitions of materials are not supposed to be included in loops being
  therefore repeated...
- Strip off white spaces from names G4GDMLWrite::GenerateName(), to avoid    (*)
  parsing problems in imported files.
- Added empty default constructor and virtual destructor to classes in the   (o)
  inheritance chain.
