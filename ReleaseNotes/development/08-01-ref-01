                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Fixed problem in rotation of final state in the coherent_elastic module
    affecting elastic scattering in hadronic physics.
  o In physics-lists, fixed initialisation problem for QBBC_HP and corrected
    flag for HP regime in G4HadronElasticPhysics() to be 'true' for LHEP_HP
    and QGSP_HP.
