------------------------

  o New method (and class member) for flagging on short step-optimisation.
    When it is true, the optimisation is 'on'; steps shorter than the
    safety will not call G4Navigator, so long as the particle goes straight
    (i.e. it is not charged or there is no field).
  o Moved call to ConfigureForTrack() in AlongStepGPIL() before the check
    for zero field. Needed to enable a user to switch a global field on
    (off was already possible), as a track goes between volume (or regions)
    of a setup; in response to a request from Atlas.

  commented out for testing.
