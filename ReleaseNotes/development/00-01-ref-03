			===================

geant4-00-01-ref-03 is geant4-00-01-ref-02 plus:

param-V00-01-00       Fixes G4FastStep::CheckIt() which was issuing a false
                      warning in a very special case.
vis-V00-01-04         - RW/STL dependence was removed from VRML 1.0 driver 
                      - Modify G4OpenGLStored SceneHandler.cc to compile on
                        Linux-g++ with STL.
greps-V00-01-00       Added G4PlacedPolyhedron.  Improved comments.
event-V00-01-00       Removed graphics_reps from GNUmakefile (no longer nec.).
shortlived-V00-01-00 and hadrons-V00-01-00a:
                      Rename 'Barion' into 'Baryon' for all class
                      names and method names.
examples-V00-01-04    Accomodate change from 'Barion' to 'Baryon'.
vis-V00-01-05         Implemented /vis/scene/add/logicalVolume.
intercoms-V00-01-00   Augmented G4VGraphicsScene.
examples-V00-01-05    Small update of exampleN03.out.
source-gmk-V00-01-00  Elimination of unnecessary printing, spelling
                      corrections.
config-V00-01-01      - Removed WARNINGs about granular libraries. 
                      - Updates for OODBMS and NT.

=========================================================================

  Please note that some class names have changed:

  G4VBarion            has been changed to G4VBaryon
  G4VBarionConstructor has been changed to G4BaryonConstructor

and the library libG4barions has been renamed to libG4baryons.

Note that for the time being subdirectory names remain unchanged,
e.g., particles/hadrons/barions.

********** REQUIRED CHANGES  ************************************

This REQUIRES changes in some PhysicsLists.  The changes in examples
and tests have already been made and are included in this tag.  But in
your own PhysicsList you might require the following change:

  G4BarionConstructor pConstructor;
  pConstructor.ConstructParticle();

should become:

  G4BaryonConstructor pConstructor;
  pConstructor.ConstructParticle();

Also you will need to remake the library map.  In geant4/source:

  gmake

but you probably will have done this anyway.

*********** END OF REQUIRED CHANGES ******************************

*********** OPTIONAL CHANGES ******************************

You might also like to change some internally used names.  E.g., in
exampleN02 the following changes, although not strictly necessary,
have also been made:

In .hh, change:
  virtual void ConstructBarions();
to:
  virtual void ConstructBaryons();

In .cc, change:
  ConstructBarions();
to: 
  ConstructBaryons();
and:
  void ExN02PhysicsList::ConstructBarions()
to:
  void ExN02PhysicsList::ConstructBaryons()

*********** END OF OPTIONAL CHANGES ******************************

global-V00-01-01

- STLInterface: Changed tolower/toupper to old implementation in cstring.h.
- STLInterface: renamed classes HashPtr and Hash to G4HashPtr and G4Hash in
  tphdict and tvhdict to make them compliant with G4 coding standards and
  avoid clashes with external software in global scope.
- STLInterface: removed useless tests over size_t < 0 in files tvordvec.h,
  tvvector.h, tpsrtvec.h and tpordvec.h.
- STLInterface: casted pointers to long in rwstlhash.h instead of unsigned.
- Added new class G4Integrator (.hh/.icc) and test file
  G4IntegratorTest.cc in HEPNumerics for integration of generic
  functions.
- Added inline keyword to G4Poisson function in HEPRandom/include
  which was missing.
