                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Extended geometry optimisation such that re-voxelisation can now apply
    to just a specific subtree if a physical volume is specified.
  o Modified solids interface to replace AddThis() with AddSolid()
    for the generation of graphics primitives.
  o New generic framework for twisted solids. Added G4TwistedTrd and
    extended G4TwistedTrap to support setups with different trapezoidal
    endcaps with centres not necessarily on a line parallel to the z axis.
  o Optimised internal interfaces for EM base classes.
  o Add corrections to standard hadron/ion ionization.
  o Added new class G4EnergyLossForExtrapolator, which can be used to estimate
    energy loss and fluctuations independently of G4 tracking
  o Updated TRD model for regular radiators to provide more realistic
    gamma spectrum.
  o Reviewed all visualization commands: improved guidance, simplified
    and rationalised the commands.
  o Added first implementation of cutaway: a clipping box for physical
    volume tree.
  o Introduced drawing of readout geometry for logical volumes.

  o Removed "Delete" methods. Removed "remove" and "edit" commands.
  o Added default G4Transform3D::Identity to objectTransformation
    argument in Draw methods.

- Implemented /vis/scene/add/userAction.
- Introduced /vis/scene/add/logo.

  G4VisCommandsViewer.
