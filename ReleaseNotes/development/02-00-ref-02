                       ===================

Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last reference
tag are:
    - fix for event reproducibility; use new Gaussian random
      distribution and shootBit function from CLHEP
    - fix for 3-momentum vector rotation in hadronic high-energy model.
    - new cross-section and energy-loss parameterisation in
      G4eBremsstrahlung standard-EM process; corrections to
      G4VhEnergyLoss and G4hIonisation.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the full list of changes is the following:


low-energy electromagnetic processes
------------------------------------
- Fix for reproducibility of events: Changed RandGauss to G4RandGauss.
- Bug fix to G4hLowEnergyIonisation, relevant for particles with
  absolute charge value greater than 1.

hadronic processes
------------------
- High-energy model: G4HEVector - fix in rotation of 3-momentum
  vectors.
- Fix for reproducibility of events in modules: models/low_energy,
  models/generator.de_excitation, util.

standard electromagnetic processes
----------------------------------
- Fix for reproducibility of events in modules: standard, muons,
  xrays, utils.
- G4eBremsstrahlung : new cross section and energy-loss parametrisation.
- Update to G4VhEnergyLoss.cc, G4VhEnergyLoss.hh, G4hIonisation.cc 
  in order to simulate energy losses of ions; correction to cross
  section for particles with spin 1.
- Removed class G4ionIonisation.
- Added initialisation of pointers in constructor of G4IhIonisation.
  Fix required for porting on Win/NT.
- Fix in G4VhEnergyLoss and G4ionIonisation in AlongStepDoIt 
  for particles with Charge^2 > 1
- Stopped very low energy photons in photo electric effect.
- Moved ElossMessenger moved to G4VEnergyLoss

photolepton-hadron processes
----------------------------
- Fix for reproducibility of events.

parameterisation processes
--------------------------
- Fix for reproducibility of events.

optical processes
-----------------
- Fix for reproducibility of events.

geometry
--------
- CSG: replaced G4Exception in G4Box::DistanceToOut(p) with simple
  warning.

global
------
- Defined G4RandGauss to invoke CLHEP's RandGaussQ, 
  needed to fix general events' reproducibility problem. 
- Added STL wrapper for in management/include/g4std.

interfaces
----------
- Fixes for porting on Win/NT.
  Removed warnings detected on HP-aCC system.

materials
---------
- Fixed initialization of pointers in G4SandiaTable constructor
  and corrected deletion of fPhotoAbsorptionCof in destructor.

visualization
-------------
- Fixed bug in /vis/lights/direction - now does not refresh view. 
- Other minor cosmetic improvements. 

configuration
-------------
- Added unsupported configuration WIN32-g++ 
  for Windows/NT/9X and Cygwin with g++ compiler.
- Changed -MM to -M in dependency file making in binmake.gmk 
  and common.gmk. This causes dependencies of both #include "..." 
  and #include <...> to be followed. 
- globlib.gmk: fix for protection from infinite loops when 
  a dir does not exist.

examples, tests
---------------
- Updates for G4hIonisation to supercede G4ionIonisation.
- Updated reference outputs.

g3tog4 tool
-----------
- Fixed initialisation of pDPhi for CONS in G3toG4MakeSolid.cc. 
- Updated README file and removed src/README.
