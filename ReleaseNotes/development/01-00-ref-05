geant4-01-00-ref-04 plus:

tracking-V01-00-00  - GetCurrentValue() in G4TrackingMessenger.cc have
                      a return value.
                    - SetUserAction in G4SteppingManager.hh: protected
                      null pointers.
neu-V01-00-01       - Fix the 'no data' problem seen in the neutron
                      transport tests.
event-V01-00-01     - Corrections for trajectories of suspended tracks.
tracking-V01-00-01  - SetUserAction methods in G4SteppingManager.hh and
                      G4TrackingManger.hh is changed for the ray
                      tracer by Makoto.
track-V01-00-00     - Bugs related track weight in G4VParticleChange have
                      been fixed.
partman-V01-00-00   - Some modification and bug fixes for implementation
                      of IsotopeTable classes.
config-V01-00-01    - Introduces G4NO_OPTIMISE. 
                    - G4DEBUG and G4OPTIMISE have been added to CPPFLAGS.
global-V01-00-03    - global-V01-00-02: Fixes to STLInterface.
                    - Correct bounds overflow in G4String::toLower()
                      and toUpper().
                    - Added resize(size_t) to G4RWTPtrVector.
examples-V01-00-01  - Includes testem-V01-00-00 above.
                    - Introduced large_N files.
                    - Updated N03 and N04.EMtest.out.
config-V01-00-02    - architecture.gmk: added option '+W823' to HP-aCC. 
                    - binmake.gmk: moved $EXTRALIBS.

Further details:

--- config-V01-00-01
- Added control for the Ray-tracer driver. Introduced
  G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER in G4VIS_USE.gmk and
  G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER in G4VIS_BUILD.gmk.
- binmake.gmk: fixed dependency order for compound libraries.
  Moved -lG4particles and -lG4materials downstream in the list.
- architecture.gmk: added G4NO_OPTIMISE for allowing compilation
  without any level of optimisation or debug. G4DEBUG if defined
  takes precedence. G4DEBUG and G4OPTIMISE are now defined also as
  CPPFLAGS.

--- global-V01-00-02
- STLInterface: several fixes.
  o Fixed bug in G4String::toUpper().
    (bug was introduced inadvertently on 20-Oct-1999).
  o Added checks for bound-overflows in G4RWTPtrSortedVector::find().
  o Fixed bound-check for operators () and [] in most collections:
    () access operators DO NOT perform bound-checking (except if
       G4DEBUG set);
    [] access operators DO perform bound-checking.
  o tpvector[.h.icc]: changed 'unsigned int' to 'size_t' in
    constructors. Added 'rwsize' and bound-checking for operator[].
  o tvvector.icc: added call to std_vector() in default constructor.
  o tpordvec.icc: added std_pvector:: scope for calls to [] operator,
    where missing.
  o tvordvec.icc: added std_vector:: scope for calls to [] operator,
    where missing.
