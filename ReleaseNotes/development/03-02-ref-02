                       ===================

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                          config-V03-02-03
------
- architecture.gmk:
  o updated list of supported systems/compilers.
  o made Linux-g++ architecture the default G4SYSTEM.
- Added Linux-egcs for old Linux architectures based on egcs-1.1.2 compiler.
- Made Linux-g++.gmk specific to gcc-2.95.2 compiler, from now on the default
  compiler on Linux systems.
- Added SUN-CC4.gmk for old SUN architectures based on CC-4.2 compiler.
- Made SUN-CC.gmk a copy of SUN-CC5.gmk (kept for backwards compatibility,
  will be removed soon). CC-5.2 compiler is now the default compiler on
  SUN systems.
- Introduced environment variable G4VIS_NONE that, if set, no visualization
  drivers are built and no vis libraries are built, not even
  libG4vis_management.  (libG4modeling is still built.)  The C-pre-processor
  variables G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE are *not* set.
- Removed the need to specify environment variables for visualization drivers
  which do not need external packages or libraries, namely :
      G4VIS_BUILD_DAWNFILE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_RAYTRACER_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_VRMLFILE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_ASCIITREE_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_GAGTREE_DRIVER
    with associated G4VIS_USE environment variables:
      G4VIS_USE_DAWNFILE
      G4VIS_USE_RAYTRACER
      G4VIS_USE_VRMLFILE
      G4VIS_USE_ASCIITREE
      G4VIS_USE_GAGTREE
  For backwards compatibility, unless G4VIS_NONE is set, the corresponding
  C-pre-processor variables are automatically set.  Also, the C-pre-processor
  variables G4VIS_BUILD and G4VIS_USE are set.
- As before, environment variables for other drivers (depending on
  external packages) still need positive setting of their G4VIS_BUILD and
  G4VIS_USE environment variables.  In this category are:
      G4VIS_BUILD_DAWN_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPACS_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLX_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLWIN32_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLXM_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OIX_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_OIWIN32_DRIVER
      G4VIS_BUILD_VRML_DRIVER
    with associated G4VIS_USE environment variables:
      G4VIS_USE_DAWN
      G4VIS_USE_OPACS
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLX
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLWIN32
      G4VIS_USE_OPENGLXM
      G4VIS_USE_OIX
      G4VIS_USE_OIWIN32
      G4VIS_USE_VRML
  In this case G4VIS_NONE must *not* be set.
- Added binmake.EXTRALIBS.README.

graphics_reps                   greps-V03-02-01
-------------
- Improvements to comments and layout in G4VisExtent.
- Added G4Scale class.

intercoms                       intercoms-V03-02-02
---------
- Added G4VGraphicsScene::AddPrimitive(const G4Scale&).

visualization                   vis-V03-02-08
-------------
- Minor fix to G4DAWNFILEViewer.
- PostScript command "showpage" is always added to g4_XX.eps
  so that it is printable (it can also be inserted into
  LaTeX documents).
- Added /vis/scene/add/scale command.
- Added G4ScaleModel.
- Fixed bug in G4BoundingSphereScene::::Accrue().
- Added G4VModel::SetExtent(const G4VisExtent&).
- Cosmetic improvements to G4BoundingSphereScene.
- Improved auto-refreshing.
- Force rebuild of graphics "stores" (graphical databases) and,
  if auto-refresh is true, refresh of all views
  (/vis/scene/notifyHandlers) after an addition to scene.
- Improved access to models (modeling-V03-02-03).
- Made G4VSceneHandler::fpModel non-const G4VModel* for convenience.
- Removed the need to specify environment variables for visualization drivers
  which do not need external packages or libraries. According
  to "config" tag above.
