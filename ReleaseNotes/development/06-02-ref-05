                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Added GetMass() method to G4LogicalVolume, returning the value in
    absolute units of the mass of a logical volume tree.
  o Introducing new G4TwistedBox and G4TwistedTrap specific shapes.
  o Implemented migration to new G4VParticleChange interface for electro-
    magnetic and generic processes.
  o Fixed precision problem for very high energy ions in gases (or with
    small step-size) in multiple-scattering.
  o Paul&Sacher PIXE low-energy electromagnetic model becomes the default.
  o Removed setup for Windows/VC++6 compiler. Now WIN32-VC refers to
    .NET VC++7.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V06-02-00
------
- Archived setup for Windows/VC++6 and removed WIN32-VC7 G4SYSTEM tag,
  now replaced by WIN32-VC, setup for VC++ .NET.
- Relaxed compilation options for SUN-CC.
- Darwin-g++.gmk:
  o Added -lXi to X11LIBS.
  o Corrected options to build granular shared libs.
    Have "-undefined define_a_way" instead of "-undefined error"
    since granular libs are not linked for the moment.

digits_hits                                      digits_hits-V06-02-01
-----------
- G4VDigi: added methods to store and retrieve HepRep attributes in same
  manner that we currently have for trajectories and hits.

event                                            event-V06-02-03
-----
- G4GeneralParticleSource: added new features, focused beam and
  multiple verteces.

----------------------
- Added Set/GetAnomaly() methods in G4Mag_SpinEqRhs equation of motion.

geometry/management                              geommng-V06-02-07
-------------------
- G4LogicalVolume:
  o Added method GetMass() to G4LogicalVolume, returning the value in absolute
    units of the mass of the logical volume tree. The mass is computed from the
    estimated geometrical volume of each solid and material's density associated
    to the logical volume and its daughters.
    The returned value is cached and can be used for successive calls (default),
    unless recomputation is forced by providing 'true' as the first boolean
    argument in input. Computation should be forced if the geometry setup has
    changed after the previous call. An optional argument to specify a material
    is provided; it is implicitely used for geometrical parameterisations by
    material.
  o Added method TotalVolumeEntities() to G4LogicalVolume, returning the
    total number of physical volumes (placed or replicated/parameterised)
    included in the tree represented by the current logical volume.
  o Fix in UpdateMaterial() for checking the existance of root-region pointer
    for logical-volume. Fixes report #684.
- G4VTouchable: added GetCopyNumber() method, clone of GetReplicaNumber().

- G4Navigator:
  o Added new access method SeverityOfZeroStepping().
  o Allow consecutive corrections for stuck tracks in ComputeStep()
    up to 10 times before aborting the event.

  sections on convex surfaces. Fixes problem report #651.
