  increase the download timeout on slow connections (only available on
  CMake 2.8.1 and above). Increased default timeout to 1500s.
- Force GEANT4_INSTALL_DATA to OFF if CMake version less than 2.8.0 is used,
  and warn user if it has been set. Following issue reported on HyperNews.
- Fix to use BASH_VERSION instead of non-POSIX compliant check.
  Addressing problem report #1306.
- Updated to reference new data set G4EMLOW-6.26.

  protons and ions. Details can be found in: Inelastic cross-sections of
  low energy electrons in silicon for the simulation of heavy ion tracks
  with theGeant4-DNA toolkit, NSS Conf. Record 2010, p80-85; Geant4 physics

  models for electrons in Si, to be published in TNS; Geant4 physics
  processes for microdosimetry simulation: very low energy electromagnetic
  models for protons and heavy ions in Si, to be published in NIMB   
  Requires G4EMLOW data set version 6.26.

  low edge of physics table when Coulomb scattering is combined with multiple
  or single scattering.
- G4UrbanMscModel95: fixed tail using single scattering model.

  parameter. Fixed use of screening function in G4eBremsstrahlungRelModel.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V09-05-09
-------------------------------
- G4EmCalculator: improved model selection for multiple-scattering processes.
- G4EmCorrections: fixed event reproducibility violation due to cashing
  of 'IonHighOrderCorrections' with a vector depending on the ion charge.
  The correction depends not only on the ion charge but also on its mass,
  therefore the cashing based on the ion charge only depends on which
  isotope is encountered first, which depends on the history and therefore
  used to violate the reproducibility. Now using a map for cashing, with
  the key given by the PDG encoding of the ion, which is unique for each
  isotope.
- G4VEmProcess: use ProposeWeight() instead of ProposeParentWeight()         (x)
  to fix weights of secondary particle for gamma processes.

  AlongStepGetPhysicalInteractionLength() method; added protection against
  zero kinetic energy into PostStepDoIt(). General cleanup of the code
- G4VMscModel: added building of transport cross-section table and new 
  method GetTransportCrossSection() to be used at run-time. Added method
  GetTransportMeanFreePath().
- G4LossTableBuilder: added method BuildTableForModel() allowing to build
  the physics-table for a model.
- G4LossTableManager: added methods MinKinEnergy() and MaxkinEnergy().
  Minor correction of number of bins per decade.
- G4EmModelManager: extended printout if cross-section table is built for
  the model.

    element, the natural average is used. 
- models/high_energy (hadr-hep-V09-05-02)
