                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Design iteration implementing modular run-manager: introduced
    G4RunManagerKernel class and simplified G4RunManager implementation.
  o Reviewed G4EventManager introducing new entry methods for
    ProcessOneEvent() to treat HepMC events and track-vectors.
  o Changed the trackID numbering scheme for 'PostposedToNextEvent'
    tracks. Now they use negative trackID.
  o Updated model interface in STD processes: added possibility to have
    STD and other processes in the same physics list.
  o Implemented the handling of diffractive photon scattering in the
    parton string models.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

event                                   event-V05-02-03
-----
- Design iteration implemeting modular run-manager:
  o With the introduction of G4RunManagerKernel class in Run category,
    G4EventManager now toggles the application states between
    'G4State_GeomClosed' and 'G4State_EventProc'.
  o A new entry method G4EventManager::ProcessOneEvent() is introduced,
    which takes HepMC event class object instead of G4Event object.
  o A new entry method G4EventManager::ProcessOneEvent() is introduced,
    which takes G4TrackVector class object.
  o G4HepMCInterface::HepMC2G4() becomes a static service method.
  o G4HepMCInterface::CheckVertexInsideWorld() is moved to
    G4VPrimaryGenerator and also becomes a static servic method.
  o Added mechanism for merging more than one kinds of primaries (HepMC
    and G4PrimaryVertex or G4TrackVector and G4PrimaryVertex).
  o Changed the trackID numbering scheme for 'PostposedToNextEvent' tracks.
    Now they use negative trackID.
  o Maintain links between pre-assigned decay products and corresponding
    primary particle. Becuse of this, G4PrimaryParticle objects of
    pre-assigned decay have proper track ID.

particles                               particles-V05-02-00
---------
- Added one void pointer to G4DynamicParticle for the sake of maintaining
  links between pre-assigned decay products and corresponding primary particle.

processes/electromagnetic/muons         muons-V05-02-01

processes/electromagnetic/utils         utils-V05-02-00
-------------------------------
- Updated model interface:
  o substituted G4Material by G4MaterialCutsCouple in dEdx and
    CrossSection methods.
  o Added methods to define energy range for multiple-scattering table
    and to change the energy range of the model.
  o Added possibility to have STD and other processes in the same
    PhysicsList.

processes/hadronic/models/chiral_inv_phase_space/body ghad-chips-body-V05-02-00
-----------------------------------------------------
- Added protection against a rounding problem in the chips evaporation. 
  Fixes a problem in gamma-nuclear reactions observed in CMS.
 
processes/hadronic/models/.../string_fragmentation    ghad-stringfrag-V05-02-00
--------------------------------------------------
- Implemented the handling of diffractive photon scattering in
  the parton string models. Mandatory for high energy gamma and
  electro-nuclear reactions.

------------------------------------------------
- Bug fix in G4QGSMSplitableHadron.

processes/hadronic/stopping                           stopp-V05-02-00
---------------------------
- Fixed few cases of memory leaks occuring at every new run.

processes/transportation                              transport-V05-02-00
------------------------
- G4Transportation: 
  o Added verbosity level to control the printing of warnings. 
  o Attempt to correct photon problem by using the velocity from current
    medium for massless particles. 
  o Use the finalVelocity to update TofF for optical photons.

run                                                   run-V05-02-01

-----------------------
- Fixed incomplete migration to Cuts per Region scheme, causing tracing
  process to crash in release 5.2.

examples                                              examples-V05-02-01
