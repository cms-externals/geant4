                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Replaced implementation of standard electro-magnetic processes with
    new STD processes, implementing new design based on model approach for
    energy loss and multiple scattering.
    + User interface and physics lists are unchanged.
    + Old energy loss processes and multiple scattering are frozen at
      release 5.2 versions. They are stored in classes with characters
      "52" at the end (G4eIonisation52, G4hIonisation52...).
  o Introduced first implementation of weight-window biasing technique.
  o Introduced utility classes for controlling event information:
    G4StackChecker, G4VUserEventInformation, G4VUserPrimaryVertexInformation
    and G4VUserPrimaryParticleInformation.
  o Introduced possibility of wavelength shifting in optical processes.
  o Fixed major bug in G4HadronicProcess, affecting final state generation
    in all materials with more than two elements.
