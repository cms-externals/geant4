    - Completed migration to STL vector for "global" category:
      migrated classes G4PhysicsTable, G4UnitsTable and G4StateManager.

    - Bug fix in calculation of electron energy in G4MuDecayChannel.
    - Introduced new module 'integral' for integral EM processes.

  existing integral processes (G4I*, G4VI*) therein.

processes/hadronic/cross_sections		cross-V03-00-00

  of G4PhysicsTable to STL vectors
  (affected files:G4NeutronHPCaptureData.cc, G4NeutronHPElasticData.cc,
   G4NeutronHPFissionData.cc, G4NeutronHPInelasticData.cc).

track			track-V03-00-04
-----

  to overcome problems due to precision issues.

visualization			vis-V03-00-08
-------------
- Changed rotation of phi-replicas in G4PhysicalVolumeModel.cc to
  ensure correspondence with rule that phi=0 bisects the replica. 

  WARNING: Prior to this fix the graphics did NOT correspond to the
  replica navigation. If you have been relying on the graphics to
  position daughter volumes in a phi-replica, navigation will have
  been incorrect, possibly without causing a crash. The above fix
  will change the apparent position as shown by the graphics and you
  will have to correct the positioning of daughters. Make sure the 
  daughters are all properly enclosed within the replica. Graphics 
  and navigation now correspond. 
- Added auto-refresh facility for OpenGL. 
- Bug fixes for problems: 
  #120: improved up vector calculation to avoid view "flipping"
        at (90, 90). 
  #157: fixed crash when viewer was defined before scene. 
  #204: fixed failure to change number of sides per circle. 
- Fixed problem when requested physical volume was at depth 2 or more. 
- Removed all references to RW wrappers. 
- Introduced many new commands (listed below). Old commands print a
  DEPRECATED warning. 
  o New compound command: 
    /vis/drawView [<theta-deg>] [<phi-deg>] 
                  [<pan-right>] [<pan-up>] [<pan-unit>] 
                  [<zoom-factor>] [<dolly>] [<dolly-unit>]
  o New primitive commands: 
    /vis/enable [true|false] 
    /vis/disable 
    /vis/verbose [] 
    /vis/viewer/set/lineSegmentsPerCircle [] 
    /vis/viewer/set/sectionPlane ... 
    /vis/viewer/set/autoRefresh 
    /vis/viewer/set/projection 
    /vis/viewer/dolly 
    /vis/viewer/dollyTo 
    /vis/viewer/lightsThetaPhi 
    /vis/viewer/lightsVector 
    /vis/viewer/pan 
    /vis/viewer/panTo

  'theta' and 'phi' parameters were reversed according to G4Sphere
  constructor. Fixes problem report #230. 
- G3Division.cc: correction for "PARA". Slices are placed with
  G4PVPlacement instead of G4PVReplica for this particular case.
