                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included since the last reference
tag are:

  o Added new parameterisation models for describing X-ray transition
    radiation generation inside radiators.
  o Major revision of G4LowEnergyCompton, G4LowEnergyRayleigh and
    G4LowEnergyGammaConversion low-energy electromagnetic processes:
    re-implementation according to the design iteration in the data domain.
  o Introduced first development release of HepRep graphics driver.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config					config-V03-02-06
------
- Introduced HepRep graphics driver environment setup:
  G4VIS_BUILD_HEPREP_DRIVER, G4VIS_USE_HEPREP.

geometry/solids/STEP			STEP-V03-02-00
-----------------------
- SdaiCONFIG_CONTROL_DESIGN.cc: cleaned up warnings issued on SUN-CC. 
- dirobj.cc: restored usage of strdup() and forced non-ANSI setup.

geometry/solids/STEPinterface		stepinterface-V03-02-00
-----------------------------
- G4Axis2Placement3dCreator::CreateG4Geometry(): added check to attribute
  validity for 'direction'.

graphics_reps				greps-V03-02-04
-------------
- Added G4Scale::GuidanceString.

parameterisations			parmodels-V03-02-00
-----------------
- Added new classes describing X-ray transition radiation generation
  inside radiators (i.e. just along incident particle track):
  G4FoamXTRdEdx[.hh.cc], G4GamDistrXTRdEdx[.hh.cc], G4IrregularXTRdEdx[.hh.cc],
  G4PlateIrrGasXTRdEdx[.hh.cc], G4RegularXTRdEdx[.hh.cc], G4VXTRdEdx[.hh.cc]
  and G4VXrayTRadModel[.hh.cc]
- Removed all references to RW wrappers. Migrated to STL vectors.

particles				particles-V03-02-03
---------
- Modifications to cope with migration of Materials to STL vector.
- Introduced G4NeutronBetaDecayChannel and added to G4Neutron.
- Allow MassDifference in case of nucleon decay.
- Modify to use G4Material::GetNumberOfMaterials().
 
processes/optical			op-V03-02-00
---------------
- Changed process name for G4OpRayleigh, G4OpBoundary and G4OpAbsorption;
  changed to 'OpRayleigh', 'OpBoundary' and 'OpAbsorption' respectively.
  This addresses problem report #293.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy	emlowen-V03-02-22
-----------------------------------
- Modifications to cope with migration of Materials to STL vector.
- Cleared compilation warnings in G4AtomicTransitionManager
- Bug fix in G4CrossSectionHandler.
- Major revision of G4LowEnergyCompton, G4LowEnergyRayleigh and
  G4LowEnergyGammaConversion: re-implementation according to the design
  iteration in the data domain.
- Fix in G4CrossSectionHandler::Clear() curing an infinite loop occurring
  in test14.
- Update to the fluorescence domain consistent with the new design.
- New class to generate shell vacancies in continuous part of processes.
- Added protection in G4LowEnergyPhotoElectric to avoid generation of
  photons causing negative energy balance.

processes/management			procman-V03-02-03
--------------------
- Modifications to cope with migration of Materials to STL vector.
- Added Set/GetProcessManager() to G4VProcess and modified 
  G4ProcessManager::AddProcess() to invoke SetProcessManager().
