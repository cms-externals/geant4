                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Multiple scattering model: new rewrite for transformations of true
    path length to geometrical length.
  o Major design iteration of G4GeneralParticleSource class.
  o Modified G4ProductionCutsTable::RetrieveCutsTable() to allow

global                                           global-V06-01-00
------
- HEPNumerics module: fixed bug in G4DataInterpolation::PolynomInterpolation()
  for indexing in a for-loop.

graphics_reps                                    greps-V06-01-00
-------------
- Implemented constructor and destructor for G4AttDefStore, to properly
  delete objects in the static map, allocated through explicit calls to
  GetInstance(). Made G4AttDefStore a singleton.

interfaces                                       interfaces-V06-01-00
----------
- G4[UI]Win32[.hh.cc]: implemented changes to allow usage of
  standard C main (and avoid WinMain).

materials                                        materials-V06-01-00
---------
- G4SandiaTable: added new methods for sorting algorithm in PAI model.

processes/cuts                                   procuts-V06-01-00
--------------
- Modified G4ProductionCutsTable::RetrieveCutsTable() to allow different
  ordering of materials and couples in a file.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  utils-V06-01-03
-------------------------------
- Fluctuations: reduced aria of applicability of the model for simulation
  of fluctuations at very small steps; smooth out sampling of Gaussian
  fluctuations, when sigma is much bigger than energy loss. The purpose
  of both changes is to provide less step dependent results. For
  example, for steps down to 0.1 mkm in solid materials energy deposition
  distribution in thin absorber is not depend on the step limit.
- Multiple scattering model: transformations of true path
  length to geometrical length and back have been completely rewritten;
  the angular distribution for e+/e- updated to provide central part of
  distribution correction to be fitted by the Highland formula. The purpose
  is to remove step limit dependence of results, which was mainly
  connected with simulation of multiple scattering of low energy
  particles. It will affect the resolution of sampling calorimeters (for
  ATLAS HEC roughly 3% reduction of the value of the resolution, compared
  to what observed in Geant4 6.1 release).
- G4VEnergyLossProcess: updated calculation of energy loss from tables
  (important for proton energies about 1 MeV and for Bragg peak
  simulation); fixed a problem of retrieving tables if PreciseRange
  is absent; fixed a problem of energy below lowestKinEnergy (simulation
  of energy loss of low energy particles in low density gases).

processes/hadronic/models/binary_cascade         ghad-bin-V06-01-00
----------------------------------------
- Adding protections for a crash and an infinite loop.
  Should solve problems reported in bug-reports #574 and #593.

processes/hadronic/models/chiral_.../body        ghad-chips-body-V06-01-03
-----------------------------------------
- Added universal G4QCaptureAtRest process (temporary from the
  photolepton_hadron directory) together with the G4QIsotope class which
  chose N for Z(Element).
- Fixed ppK+ "antistrange below mass shell" problem in G4QEnvironment.
- Minor bug fixes in G4QEnvironment in (Sigma-)2n final state.
- Fixed rare problem of decay in Del+Del+ with pi0 when pi- was found.
- Minor bug fix in final multibaryon spit (3n->n+n+n).

processes/optical                                op-V06-01-01
-----------------
- Fixes in G4OpBoundaryProcess for default class member assignments
  in DoIt() method.
- Added protection against NULL pointers in G4OpRayleigh process.
  Do not overwrite Rayleigh scattering length for 'Water' material if it has
  been specified by the user through a call to AddProperty("RAYLEIGH"...).

visualization                                    vis-V06-01-01
-------------
- OpenGL: added G4OpenGL.hh wrapper file and adapted code to encapsulate
  inclusion of gl/gl.h and gl/glu.h that may be platform dependent.
  Cleared WIN32 ifdefs no longer necessary.
- VRML (VRML-V06-01-00):
  o Fixed typo in printout in G4VRML[1/2]FileSceneHandler.cc files.

g3tog4                                           g3tog4-V06-01-00
------
- Removed hardwired gSeparator constant (a character which is used
  during generation of volume names) to '_'. Now gSeparator is made non
  constant and so can be changed in case a user wants to use '_' in his
  code. Modified files: G3toG4.hh, clparse.cc.
