                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o New scheme for non-static particle definitions: all particle definition
    class objects are dynamically instantiated along the invocation of the
    ConstructParticle() method of the user's G4VUserPhysicsList concrete
    class. This new scheme allows for the user to set alternative physics
    quantities before particles are instantiated in Geant4.
  o Design iteration for GFlash parameterisation: added concrete sampling
    shower parameterisation and tuning classes.
  o Added new utility methods to G4VPhysical volume for identification of
    specific regular structures for the geometry setup.
  o Added new filter and scoring classes to allow for scoring (such as dose
    or energy-deposition) relevant in particular to medical and space
    applications. Added new extended example.
  o Added high energy elastic scattering on protons (G4ElasticHadrNucleusHE)
    in hadronic coherent-elastic model.
  o New capture process G4QCaptureAtRest valid for pi-, K-, anti-proton, mu-,
    tau-, Xi-, Omega-, neutron, anti-neutron, anti-Sigma+.
  o Introduced required changes for support of CLHEP-2.0.X series.

event                                            event-V07-01-06
-----
- Migration to <sstream> from deprecated <strstream>.
- Removed dependency on CLHEP/HepMC:
  moved G4HepMC classes to extended examples.
- Issue G4Exception from constructors of G4UserEventAction and
  G4UserStackingAction to protect against their instantiation before
  G4VUserPhysicsList is instantiated and set to G4RunManager.
- Added protection against null pointer to
  G4ParticleGun::SetParticleDefinition().
- Trivial fixes to G4SPSAngDistribution and G4SPSPosDistribution for
  support of CLHEP-2.0.X series.

digits_hits                                      digits_hits-V07-01-04
-----------

g3tog4                                           g3tog4-V07-01-01
------
- Implemented migration to <sstream> from deprecated <strstream>.
- GNUmakefile: moved call to 'cernlib' to 'bin' target.

geometry/divisions                               geomdiv-V07-01-02
------------------
- Adapted to revision of G4VPhysicalVolume for identification of regular
  structures; added two methods to G4PVDivision: IsRegularStructure()
  and GetRegularStructureId().

geometry/management                              geommng-V07-01-05
-------------------
- Revised G4VPVParameterisation:
  + Changed signature to ComputeMaterial(), adding parent touchable pointer.
    This refinement enables easy use of nested parameterisations.
    Additional methods allow nested parameterisation to be identified:
      G4bool IsNested() const;
    and to provide their material via the new interface class
    G4VVolumeMaterialScanner:
      G4VVolumeMaterialScanner* GetMaterialScanner();
    As a result of this change, the temporary class G4PhysicalTouchable
    in volumes is not needed any longer in the implementation and has
    been suppressed.
- Added pure virtual methods used to identify regular structures in
  G4VPhysicalVolume:
     G4bool IsRegularStructure() const;
  returning true if the underlying volume structure is regular.
     G4int GetRegularStructureId() const;
  returning non-zero code in case the underlying volume structure
  is regular (voxel-like). The value 'id' is for structure type. If non-zero
  the volume is a candidate for specialised navigation such as 'nearest
  neighbour' directly on volumes.

geometry/navigation                              geomnav-V07-01-02
-------------------
- Revised G4ParameterisedNavigation to use new interface for
  ComputeMaterial(); it no longer needs the 'Physical Touchable'.

-------------------
- G4Torus: fixed bug in Inside(p) for phi sections.
  Fixes problem report #810.

- Trivial fixes for porting on CLHEP-2.0.X series.
- G4VTwistedFaceted:
  o corrected bug in DistanceToSurface() implementation;
  o added GetPointOnSurface() method.
- G4TwistedTubs: added GetPointOnSurface() method
- G4Hype: corrected surface area calculation used in GetPointOnSurface().
- More fixes required for direct object persistency to G4Polycone,
  G4polyhedra and related utility classes.

geometry/volumes                                 geomvol-V07-01-05
----------------
- Revised implementation of G4VNestedParameterisation, removing use
  of G4PhysicalTouchable and removed G4PhysicalTouchable helper class.
  Added implementations of virtual methods to identify materials
  for nested parameterisations.
- Added methods to identify regular structures in physical volume derived
  classes (replicas, parameterised volumes and placements):
  IsRegularStructure() and GetRegularStructureId().
  Note that for G4PVPlacement always return 'false' and 0 respectively.

global                                           global-V07-01-06
------
- Changed header file from version.hh to G4Version.hh.
- Fix in G4strstreambuf destructor to avoid double flushing of buffer.
- templates.hh: get rid of hard-coded numbers for DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, DBL_DIG,
  DBL_MAX, FLT_DIG, FLT_MAX/MAXFLOAT. Use numeric_limits from <limits> instead.

graphics_reps                                    greps-V07-01-09
-------------
- G4Colour: Use public static member functions instead of public
  static data members to avoid problems with dynamic libraries.
- G4VVisManager and G4VGraphicsScene: Replaced default arguments
  G4Transform3D::Identity by G4Transform3D(), to avoid initialisation
  problems with static objects with dynamic libraries.
  Fixed Dispatch method name to "DispatchToModel" in G4VVisManager.
- Implemented migration to support CLHEP-2.0.X, adding explicit namespace
  to CLHEP types. Affected files: HepPolyhedron[.h.cc], BooleanProcessor.src.
- Moved G4VTrajectoryDrawer (an abstract base class for trajectory drawers)
  to visualization/modeling and renamed G4VTrajectoryModel.

    model.
- models/chiral_invariant_phase_space:
  + The Charged Currents (nu,mu) neutrino-nuclear reactions are now
    implemented for all energies. The recommended energy is below 320 GeV,
    where the model is compared with data. Above 320 GeV it is just a formal
    extrapolation. Both Quasi Elastic and Inelastic interactions are
    implemented. In future the developed non-perturbative CHIPS method can be
    used for simulation of (nu,e) reactions.
  + New capture process G4QCaptureAtRest valid for pi-, K-, anti-proton, mu-,
    tau-, Xi-, Omega-, neutron, anti-neutron, anti-Sigma+.

  + Added four new models: G4NeutronHPorLCapture, G4NeutronHPorLEInelastic,
    G4NeutronHPorLElastic, G4NeutronHPorLFission.
    These models should be used instead of the corresponding
    G4NeutronHPCapture, G4NeutronHPInelastic, G4NeutronHPElastic or
    G4NeutronHPFission models when a detector setup contains elements or
    isotopes not found in the G4NDL data set. The new models use the existing
    high precision models when data exist, but switch to the Low Energy
    Parameterized models when data is absent, thus avoiding a crash.

---

  G4UserRunAction to protect against their instantiation before
  G4VUserPhysicsList is instantiated and set to G4RunManager.

  from G4RunManagerKernel::InitializePhysics().
- Invocation of G4ParticleTable::GetParticleTable()->SetReadiness();

  method. This change enforces that all particles must be instantiated in
  ConstructParticle() method in the physics-list along with the introduction
  of non-static particle definition classes.
- In G4RunManagerKernel.cc, changed inclusion of version.hh to G4Version.hh.
