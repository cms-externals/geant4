    modification.
  o Use SampleScattering() method instead of SampleSecondaries().
  o Use different correction to Highland formula for different particle
    types (electron, muons, others...).

    for heavy particles (mu, hadrons).
  o Small modification of theta0 in ComputeTheta0() (based on data).
  o Some old inconsistency/bug has been fixed in SampleCosineTheta():
    now the value of 'prob' is always between [0,1].
- G4eCoulombScatteringModel, G4CoulombScatteringModel: using precomputed
  Z^1/3 and log(A) values to speed up code; revised nuclear size correction.

    correcting the units for the Pauli Blocking Factor (missing a g factor);
    decreasing the number of charged particles if the number excitons is
    decreased (previously this number was only increased with increasing
    excitons).
