---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

(o)  Fixes included in release 9.3.p01

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

geometry/management                              geommng-V09-03-00           (o)
-------------------
- Added explicit initialisation of min/max extent for mother and target
  volumes in method BuildNodes() of G4SmartVoxelHeader.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V09-03-01     (o)
------------------------
- Use kInfinity for initialising minimum and maximum allowed extent for
  G4SolidExtentList of faceted solids.
- Adopt caching of 'Phi' in G4PolyconeSide and G4PolyhedraSide to avoid
  unnecessary consecutive computations on the same point.

persistency/gdml                                 gdml-V09-03-01              (o)

  of materials property vectors. Increased string buffer in G4GDMLWrite.
  Addressing problem report #1104.
- Corrected import of surface properties in G4GDMLReadSolids for the case
  of recursive read of files.
- Added IsValid() method to parser to verify if variable/constant/quantity
  is defined and is valid. Added const qualifier to reader accessors in parser.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy              emlowen-V09-03-03
-----------------------------------
- Fixed initialisation of 'atomTotalCrossSection' in class                   (o)
  G4hShellCrossSectionDoubleExp.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V09-03-02
----------------------------------
- G4GoudsmitSaundersonMscModel, G4GoudsmitSaundersonTable: fixed problems of
  small angle theta distributions.
- G4CoulombScatteringModel: added comments to relativistic formula.          (o)
- G4eCoulombScatteringModel: added method SetLowEnergyLimit().               (o)
- Set default value G4eCoulombScatteringModel to 1 eV (before was 100 eV).
- G4CoulombScattering: removed inline method SetBuildTableFlag() which was   (o)
  hiding implementation in the base class.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V09-03-02           (o)
-------------------------------
- G4VEmProcess: fixed problem for ion processes by adding pointer to
  'currentParticle' which may be different from generic ion.
  Moved SetBuildTableFlag() method to public.

processes/hadronic
------------------
- cross_sections (hadr-cross-V09-03-00)                                      (o)
  o G4UPiNuclearCrossSection: fixed bug for high Z (>83) atoms.
- models/cascade (hadr-casc-V09-03-07)
  o Replaced all uses of bindingEnergy() (local Bertini method) with the
    Geant4 standard G4NucleiProperties::GetBindingEnergy(A,Z) in classes
    G4IntraNuclearCascader, G4InuclCollider, G4NucleiModel, G4Fissioner,
    G4EquilibriumModel and G4NonEquilibriumModel.
    G4Fissioner still uses Bertini method bindingEnergyAsymptotic().
  o G4InteractionCase: minor fix in initialisation in constructor to         (o)
    allow for porting on C++0x Standard.
  o G4Diproton, G4Dineutron, G4UnboundPN: new G4ParticleDefinition
    subclasses, which implement the Bertini-specific dibaryon states.
    These are not used anywhere as yet, but will be used in future
    modifications to the G4InuclParticle subclasses.
  o G4ElementaryParticleCollider: replaced original (incorrect) pp, pn, nn
    2-body to 2-body scattering angular distributions with a new
    parameterization of elastic scattering data using the sum of two
    exponentials.
- models/chiral_inv_phase_space (hadr-chips-V09-03-04)
  o Updated proton elastic and CHIPS parameters.
  o Implemented anti-baryon elastic interactions.
  o Added pion elastic and fixed a bug in CHIPS fragmentation.
  o Clean-up and fixed compilation warnings.
- models/coherent_elastic (hadr-cohe-V09-03-01)
  o Use G4Q(Proton/Neutron)ElasticCrossSection instead of
    G4QElasticCrossSection; fixed initialization problem for
    G4QNeutronElasticCrossSection.
- models/de_excitation (hadr-deex-V09-03-02)                                 (o)
  o G4ExcitationHandler: activated FermiBreakUp.
- models/high_energy (hadr-hep-V09-03-00)                                    (o)
  o Fixed case of segmentation fault in G4HEKaonZeroLongInelastic and 
    G4HEKaonZeroShortInelastic due to local instantiation and subsequent
    deletion of the K0 and anti-K0 models.
    This was fixed by implementing code specifically for
    G4HEKaonZeroLongInelastic and G4HEKaonZeroShortInelastic, without
    using the K0, anti-K0 code. As an added feature, the production of
    K0 and anti-K0 outside the nucleus is now prohibited.

- models/pre_equilibrium (hadr-pre-V09-03-01)                                (o)
  o G4PreCompoundEmission: added protection against unphysical value of 
    parameter 'an' when exitation energy is huge to avoid numerical problems.

tracking                                         tracking-V09-03-00          (o)
--------
- G4RichTrajectory: Fixed bug in MergeTrajectory(), to not invoke
  G4Trajectory::MergeTrajectory().
- G4RichTrajectory and G4RichTrajectoryPoint: eliminated spaces in G4AttValue
  values; G4AttValue values are "None" for attributes derived from zero
  pointers.

examples                                         examples-V09-03-02
--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- advanced/microbeam (microbeam-V09-03-01)                                   (o)
  o Added density initialisation in MicrobeamPhantomConfiguration and
    changed material/density selection.
- advanced/underground_physics (DMX-V09-03-00)                               (o)
  o Physics list migrated from LowEnergy processes to the new Livermore 
    models. Physics results unchanged for gamma/e-. Possible differences 
    with ions/protons.
  o Corrected analysis-manager to solve a problem with the HBOOK output files
    (ntuples not filled, histograms not saved). Get rid of a warning message
    and allocation problems with ntuple2.
- extended/electromagnetic/TestEm2 (testem2-V09-03-00)
  o Added histos rms on profiles (histos numbering is changed) and new scripts.

tests                                            tests-V09-03-02
-----
- Updated reference outputs and tools.
- test19 (test19-V09-03-00)
  o Added elastic cross-sections test.
- test21 (test21-V09-03-00)
  o Use separate MultipleScattering for e, Mu, and hadrons.
- test39 (test39-V09-03-00)
  o Separated test for G4QProtonElCS and G4QNeutronElCS, and made more
    compact by reducing t-table.
  o Extended to test all-hadrons for elastic scattering.
