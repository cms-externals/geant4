                       ===================

Some of the improvements and fixes included since the last reference
tag are:
    - introduction of ParticleGun for Ions and weights for
      primary vertex and particle.
    - fix in G4Decay to avoid direct modification of G4Track by
      the Decay process.
    - fix in G4Cerenkov and G4Scintillation to correct usage of
      the step length to position the origins of secondaries.
    - fixes in CSGs G4Cons and G4Tubs to improve stability of roots
      of quadratic equations.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:


decay physics process
---------------------
- Bug fix in G4Decay to avoid direct modification of G4Track by
  the Decay process.

optical physics processes
-------------------------
- G4OpAbsorption.cc:
  o commented out the warning - "No Absorption length specified" 
    NOTE: this will change the output of example/novice/N06 in 
    that these warnings are no longer going to be there.

electromagnetic processes (standard)
------------------------------------
- Bug fix in G4Cerenkov and G4Scintillation: corrected usage of
  the 'step length' to position the origins of secondaries.

hadronic processes
------------------
- G4RadioactiveDecay: fix to const-ness of G4DynamicParticle to
  co-work with latest changes in 'track' module.

event
-----
- Introduced ParticleGun for Ions and weights for primary vertex
  and particle:
  o G4ParticleGun: added Set/GetParticleCharge methods for ions. 
  o G4ParticleGunMessenger: added new command of /gun/ion;
    modified command of /gun/particle.
  o G4PrimaryParticle: add Set/GetCharge methods, added weight.
  o G4PrimaryVertex: added weight.
  o G4PrimaryTransformer: use G4PrimaryParticle::GetCharge to give
    dynamic charge in G4DynamicParticle; set weight of G4Track.

geometry
--------
- CSG solids
  o Fix to G4Tubs and G4Cons in DistanceToIn/DistanceToOut: 
    + fixes to DistanceToOut(p,v,...) to make roots of quadratic
      equations more stable.
    + added check against negative distance returned.
  o Fixes to G4Cons:
    + corrected condition on conical surface to consider a real
      projection of the conical surface thickness on XY plane
      (0.5*kCarTolerance*secRMin instead of 0.5*kCarTolerance),
      when dealing with cons with large opening angle.
    + fix in constructor to check if one of the Rmin different than 0,
      to avoid degenerated cones.
  o G4Torus: introduced Newton-based numerical method for computing
    roots of equations in DistanceToIn() and DistanceToOut().
- specific solids
  Fix in G4IntersectingCone.cc: the check for a zero radical has been
  adjusted to be less sensitive to round off error in LineHitsCone1(),
  LineHitsCone2().

particles
---------
- Some bug fixes according to CodeWizard's suggestions.
- Added const to G4DynamicParticle::GetPreAssignedDecayProducts.
- Added method G4IonTable::GetElementNumber.
- Added comment in case of G4Exception in G4IonTable.cc.
- Added neutron life time.
- Fixed stable flag for G4PionMinus.

track
-----
- Bug fixes in copy constructor of G4ParticleChange.
- Added "const" to G4DynamicParticle pointer of returned value of 
  G4Track::GetDynamicParticle (track-V02-00-00) 

visualization
-------------
- G4PhysicalVolumeModel: added protection against volumes without
  material.
- Removed /vis/viewer/update from compound commands /vis/drawVolume
  and /vis/specify.

config
------
- Introduced changes to handle analysis module.
  o added analysis.gmk.
  o sys/Linux-g++.gmk: added macro DLDLIBS for library dynamic loading.
  o binmake.gmk: added inclusion of analysis.gmk.
  o binmake.gmk: place LDLIBS3 += $(ANALYSISLIBS)
    after LDLIBS3 += $(INTYLIBS).
- Incorporated building of shared libraries into .gmk files
  (not yet operative, still under testing)
  o merged building shared libraries into makefiles.
    The MAKESHLIB script is no longer used.
  o Introduced new variables steering the building of static/shared libs.
    (static still default).
  o Introduced new variable (G4LIB_USE_GRANULAR) to force using of
    granular libraries.
