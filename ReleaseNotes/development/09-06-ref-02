                       ===================

Major development/fixes included since the last development tag are:

 o Introduced merged changes (non-optimised) from Geant4-MT prototype
   required for multi-threading.
   Currently disabled and kept running in sequential mode.
 o Important fix to G4VMultipleScattering and G4VMscModel classes for the
   use of after the migration of multiple-scattering sampling from
   PostStepDoIt() to AlongStepDoIt(), responsible for observed mis-behavior
   in presence of magnetic-field. Addressing problem report #1403.
 o Removed obsolete model 'isotope_production'.


---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

(*)  Fixes included in release 9.6.p01

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V09-06-03
--------
- Fixed cases of hang-ups in G4ExtrudedSolid on 32-bits platforms, due to    (*)
  G4TessellatedSolid and G4SurfVoxelizer, caused by accessing bitmask arrays
  with negative indexes. The problem was related to floating-point rounding,
  which can be different even on same platform with debug/release version.
  Assure same number of computed voxels on 32-bit/64-bit platforms.
  Fixed error in SetVertexIndex() method, which might cause problems on
  certain configurations even for 64-bit systems. Fixed minor memory leaks.
  Code cleanup for use of G4endl and tabs...
- Fixed condition in G4VTwistSurface::GetBoundaryLimit() for logical error.  (*)
  Addressing problem report #1420.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V09-06-06
----------------------------------
- Fixed signature of SampleScattering() for all multiple-scattering models.  (*)
  Addressing problem report #1403.
- G4UrbanMscModel93, G4UrbanMscModel95: use more safe expressions in         (*)
  SampleCosineTheta() to avoid numerical problems.
- G4UrbanMscModel96: new tuning of Urban model.                              (*)

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V09-06-03
-------------------------------
- G4VMultipleScattering, G4VMscModel: fixed signature of SampleScattering(). (*)
  Use momentum direction from PostStepPoint instead of G4DynamicParticle.
  Fixing major bug of migration of nultiple-scattering sampling from
  PostStepDoIt() to AlongStepDoIt(), responsible for observed mis-behavior
  in presence of magnetic-field.
  Addressing problem report #1403.
- G4VMultipleScattering: position is changed to PostStep as it was in 9.6.

processes/hadronic
------------------
- Removed obsolete model 'isotope_production'.
- cross_sections (hadr-cross-V09-06-03)                                      (*)
  o Fixed memory leak in cross-sections for GetZandACrossSection().
    Addressing problem report #1424.
  o Fixed bug to G4ComponentAntiNuclNuclearXS and added class description.
- models/binary_cascade (had-binary-V09-06-02)
  o Implemented interface to Precompound model for nucleus-nucleus 
    interactions at high (> 2GeV/N).
  o Use of simplified G4GeneratorPrecompoundInterface::Propagate() for
    hadron-nucleus interactions and adoption of PropagateNuclNucl() for
    simulation of nucleus-nucleus interactions..
- models/im_r_matrix (hadr-im_r-V09-06-00)                                   (*)
  o Fix in G4Scatterer::GetTimeToInteraction(); one shortcut in the
    calculation of time was missed, as only one of the two particles was
    checked. Physics unchanged, but small performance gain of few percent.
    Addressing problem report #1334.
- models/inclxx (hadr-inclxx-V09-06-01)                                      (*)

- models/radioactive_decay (radioactive_decay-V09-06-01)                     (*)
  o G4RadioactiveDecay: force boost of the decay products. The parent energy
    considered in the boost is the total energy of the fully stripped parent
    ion rather than the total energy of dynamic ion where the energy of shell
    electrons is taken into account.
    Some difference in momentum and energy balance is still observed but much
    less than before. Addressing problem report #1359.
