                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Implemented specific computation of surface area for CSG solids and
    included caching mechanism for the computed value. For all other solids
    computation is approximated using MC method.
  o Added methods to access vector of names of NIST elements and materials.
  o Updated mass, width, and particles encoding to match with PDG2006.
    Introduced PDG encoding for nuclei.
  o Developments and fixes for atomic deexcitation in low-energy EM models.
  o New revision for G4MultipleScattering and G4UrbanMscModel: modified
    stepping, angular distribution and implemented more effective safety
    update.
  o Deprecated old EM standard processes '52' and '71' types.
  o Extended range of validity to 1TeV for G4ProtonInelasticCrossSection,
    using constant cross section above 20GeV.
  o Review and update of the class G4ElasticHadrNucleusHE: data tables are
    computed on-flight, G4ELASTICDATA data set is no longer used.
    Model now applicable for all nuclei, except deuteron, triton, He3, and
    A>238.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------


Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V08-01-05
------
- architecture.gmk: added variables for commands: echo, cat, cut, sed;
  to be eventually overloaded in system dependent configurations.
- WIN32-VC.gmk: overload commands [echo, grep, cat, cut, sed], to force
  usage of the original CygWin built-in commands.
- Darwin-g++.gmk: use standard -echo- command.
  Removed ECHO overloaded variable.
- liblist.c: added .dylib search for list of libraries.
  Addressing problem report #885.
- source/GNUmakefile (source-gmk-V08-01-00): replaced system commands
  with variables defined at architecture level.

geometry/management                              geommng-V08-01-05
-------------------
- Added GetSurfaceArea() method to G4VSolid for approximated computation
  of the surfare area of a shape.

geometry/navigation                              geomnav-V08-01-02
-------------------
- G4Navigator:
  o Added inline methods EnteredDaughterVolume() and ExitedMotherVolume() to
    allow for verification of a point entering a daughter volume or exiting
    the mother volume. Moved related data members to protected.
  o Made LocateGlobalPointAndSetup() method virtual. Moved to non virtual
    and inline LocateGlobalPointAndUpdateTouchableHandle() method.
  o Moved 'fHistory' data member to protected to allow for more complete
    subclassing.
  o Minor cosmetics to recently introduced printout diagnostics in
    ComputeSafety() method.
- G4TransportationManager:
  o Added methods to access the list of the registered worlds.

geometry/solids                                  geomsolids-V08-01-00
---------------
- Implemented specific computation of surface area for CSG solids and
  included caching mechanism for the computed value.

global                                           global-V08-01-03
------

-------------
- G4VisAttributes: changed GetAttValues() to CreateAttValues().
  It creates an expendable copy on the heap, thus following the behaviour
  of CreateAttValues() in trajectories, hits, etc. This achieves consistency
  of behaviour and user expectation; the user is responsible for deletion
  after use.
- New utility class G4AttHolder to hold G4AttValues and their corresponding
  G4AttDef map.
- G4AttDefStore: changed GetName() type from 'G4String' to 'const G4String&'.
- Added operator<<() for G4AttDefs.
- Improved output diagnostics.

materials                                        materials-V08-01-01
---------
- Added methods to access vector of names of NIST elements and materials.
- Added methods GetAtomicMass(), AddIsotopeMass(), returning atom mass and
  nuclear mass in Geant4 units.
- Added GetTotalBindingEnergy() method to G4AtomicShells.
- Added Get/SetNaturalAbundancesFlag().

particles                                        particles-V08-01-04
---------

- Introduced PDG encoding for nuclei.
- Added G4Exception warning if sum of daughter mass exceeds parent mass
  in G4PhaseSpaceDecayChannel.

  mass and charge if users do not specify them.

processes/electromagnetic/highenergy             emhighenergy-V08-01-00
------------------------------------
- Added G4mplIonisation and G4mplIonisationModel classes implementing
  ionisation for classic magnetic monopole.
- G4hhIonisation: added 'maxKinEnergy' class member (100 TeV).

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy              emlowen-V08-01-02
-----------------------------------
- Bug fixes in G4FluoData class.
- Developments and fixes for atomic deexcitation.
- Cosmetics on code formatting for DNA processes.

processes/electromagnetic/muon                   emmuons-V08-01-01
------------------------------
- Added deprecation warning to all processes '52' type.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               emstand-V08-01-10
----------------------------------
- New revision for G4MultipleScattering and G4UrbanMscModel:
  o Modified stepping:
    + min. steplimit in 8.1: tlimitmin = max(lambda/25, 5 nanometer)
                  now      : tlimitmin = max(lambda/25, 1.01*stepmin)
           where stepmin ~ lambda elastic
    + Introduced possibility to have extreme small step(s) before boundary
      crossing (feature not active by default); it can be activated by setting
      the data member 'skin' to a non-negative value, steplimit = stepmin, if
      the distance to the boundary (in the original direction) is smaller than
      skin*stepmin. Parameter 'skin' set to 1 by default.
    + The step restriction is weaker for particles with higher energy, i.e.,
      bigger effective 'facrange' value is used in this case; in 8.0/8.1 this
      'scaling' depends on 'Tkin', in the new version the 'scaling' depends on
      'lambda', giving smaller material dependence.
  o Angular distribution has been changed:
    + Single/plural scattering for 'step <= stepmin' (in this case
      t = z + no lateral displacement).
    + Parameter 'theta0' has been (sligtly) modified.
    + The tail of the distribution has been modified, now the parameter
      describing the tail is material (i.e. Z) dependent.
  o Implemented more effective safety update in G4UrbanMscModel for
    SampleSecondaries(), and come cosmetics.
- G4hMultipleScattering: new class configured for hadrons.
- G4eCoulombScatteringModel:
  o Set cross section constant for energies below 1 keV.
  o Make G4CoulombScatteringModel inherit from it; screening parameter
    computation is done in inline function.
- G4BraggIonModel: reduced lowest energy for parameterisation to 0.25 keV
- G4eeToTwoGammaModel: introduced new member 'theGamma'.
- Added extra protection to G4eplusAnnihilation52, and deprecation warning
  to all processes '52' and '71' type.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  emutils-V08-01-05
-------------------------------
- G4LossTableManger: added method GetEnergyLossProcess().
- G4EmCalculator:
  o 10 keV - 1 keV energy to access lowEnergy ionisation.
  o Added computation of smoothing factor for dedx of hadrons/ions.

processes/hadronic
------------------
- cross_sections (hadr-cross-V08-01-05)
  o G4ProtonInelasticCrossSection: extended range of validity to 1TeV,
    using constant cross section above 20GeV.
  o G4GlauberGribovCrossSection::GetCrossSection(): fixed bug in inelastic
    cross section. Bug was discovered in the paper from which the cross
    was derived.
- management (hadr-man-V08-01-00)
  o G4HadronicProcess: removed unused method GetDistanceToBoundary().
- models/coherent_elastic (hadr-cohe-V08-01-05)
  o Set 'lowestEnergy' to zero for neutral particles.
  o G4ElasticHadrNucleusHE:
    + Set threshold to 1 GeV for the model.
    + Completed review and update of the class: data tables are computed
      on-flight, G4ELASTICDATA data set is no longer used.
      The model is applicable for all nuclei, except deuteron, triton,
      He3, and A>238.
- models/util (hadr-mod-util-V08-01-01)
  o Reduced warning output from G4Fragment on negative excitation energy;
    a maximum of 10 warnings is printed now.
  o G4Fancy3DNucleus:ChoosePositions(): correctly use std::vector.
    Correction addressing problem report #887 on WIN32/VC8.
