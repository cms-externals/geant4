                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Fixes in neutron and de-excitation hadronic models.
  o Added possibility to tune precision for DAWNFILE visualization driver.
  o Some fixes and improvements to G4AssemblyVolume.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                  config-V04-01-02
------
- Linux-g++.gmk:
  added assignment 'CC := gcc' for default 'cc' compiler.

geometry/management                     geommng-V04-01-00
-------------------
- G4AssemblyVolume[.hh.icc.cc]:
  o Fixed bug #409 concerning missing imprint counter method. 
  o Fixed bug #410 concerning the internal counting mechanism. 
    The fix involved the addition of a new data member fAssemblyID, 
    holding the instance ID of the given object derived from class-wide
    counter. Corresponding accessor methods has been added as well. 
- Updated unit test TestAssemblyVolume, to add call to G4RunManager 
  for resetting navigator state in TstVADetectorConstruction.cc.

processes/hadronic/models/neutron_hp    neu-V04-01-00
------------------------------------
- Added a few protections (for negative cross-sections due
  to interpolation uncertainties).
- Implemented one rare inelastic (sub-sub-)case. 

processes/hadronic/models/generator/de_excitation   de_excitation-V04-01-02
-------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a memory violation in light Fragments (Hydrogen of He3).

visualization				vis-V04-01-00
-------------
- Precision control of g4_XX.prim files are now generated by the
  DAWNFILE/DAWN-Network drivers, by use of a new variable for tuning
  precision G4DAWNFILE_PRECISION. Default precision is now set to
  9 digits.
- Cosmetic changes in G4OpenGL for DEC-cxx compiler.

examples
--------
- extended/advanced/underground_physics (dmx-V04-01-01):
  o corrected over-lapping volumes and inefficient physics list.
