-----
- Do not switch off CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS in Geant4Config; not required for
  client applications. Addresses problem report #2002.
- Fixed logic of setting up components in Geant4Config.cmake.
  Addresses problem report #2139.
- Fixed issue for path with spaces, reported in Users Forum #451.

config                                           config-V10-05-02
------
- Fixed default paths for Linux architectures.

digits_hits                                      digits_hits-V10-05-05
-----------
- G4SDStructure: fixed cases of strings passed by value instead of
  by reference.
- Added G4TScoreNtupleWriter and G4TScoreNtupleWriterMessenger
  which implements storing hits collections of G4THitsMap type vith
  Geant4 analysis tools, define them in G4VcoreNtupleWriter.
  The dependency on the analysis category is avoided via template.

geometry/management                              geommng-V10-05-08
-------------------

  alias using statements.
- Made G4RegularNavigationHelper a G4ThreadLocalSingleton.
- G4Navigator: further fix to avoid creating useless ostringstream object
  responsible for measured memory churn in last Q/A measurements; now it is
  created for each step only when debug flags are set.
- Enable UI command "/geometry/navigator/push_notify" which was not
  setup properly. Addressing problem report #2173.
- Fixed builds with debug flags.

------------------------
- Fixed generation of polyhedron in G4UExtrudedSolid::CreatePolyhedron().
  Addressing visualization part of the problem report #2171.
  Complete fix requires upgrade to VecGeom v1.1.3.
- Avoid defining kCarTolerance as 'static const' in G4VFacet.
  Addressing problem report #2172.

geometry/volumes                                 geomvol-V10-05-02

  const iterators, alias using statements.

global                                           global-V10-05-11
------
- Updated date and tag-ID for geant4-10-05-ref-07.

particles                                        particles-V10-05-06
---------
- G4DynamicParticle: restore 10.5 definition and use of PDG code variable
  in order to preserve handling of exotic particles; keep formatting
  of the class in one style, removed extra empty lines.

physics_lists/constructors/decay                 phys-ctor-decay-V10-05-00
--------------------------------
- G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics: replaced G4RadioactiveDecay with
  G4RadioactiveDecayBase. This removes the biasing functionality which
  is generally not used in the physics lists.

processes/electromagnetic/highenergy             emhighenergy-V10-05-03
------------------------------------
- G4mplIonisationWithDeltaModel, G4mplIonisationModel: fixed dEdx for
  electron gas model (beta<0.01). Addressing problem report #2169.

processes/hadronic
------------------
- cross_sections (hadr-cross-V10-05-18)
  o G4BGGNucleonElasticXS, G4BGGNucleonInelasticXS: fixed initialisation
    for protons and neutrons by usage of separate vectors of correction
    coeffitients.
  o G4BGGPionInelasticXS: fixed low-energy parameterisation (restore
    one from Geant4 10.5, where low-energy limits were different for 
    pi+ and pi-).
  o G4NeutronCaptureXS: restored computation of isotope x-section as it
    was in release 10.5, responsible for degradation of observables on
    Tungsten.
- models/de_excitation (hadr-deex-V10-05-08)
  o G4EvaporationChannel, G4EvaporationProbability, G4VEmissionProbability,
    G4NeutronEvaporationProbability, G4VEvaporationChannel: preparation for
    development of new GEM model; for evaporation improved selection of final
    excitation level for residual fragments.
  o G4LevelReader: attempt to reduce memory churn at initialisation.
- models/lepto_nuclear (hadr-lepnuc-V10-05-02)
  o Fixed cases of arrays out of boundaries for indexes of x- in
    G4NuMuNucelusCc/NcModel.
- models/particle_hp (hadr-hpp-V10-05-06)
  o G4ParticleHPChannel, G4ParticleHPNames: allow using an incomplete data
    library name if the environment variable G4NEUTRONHP_SKIP_MISSING_ISOTOPES
    is set. The missing cross-sections are then set to 0. 
  o G4ParticleHPContAngularPar: redefined residual mass to consider incident 
    particles other than neutrons.
  o G4ParticleHPInelasticBaseFS: added protection against residual with Z<0 or
    A<Z, do not apply adjust_final_state when data is in MF=6 format (no
    correlated particle emission)
  o Correction to add Q value info to G4ParticleHPNBodyPhaseSpace.
  o G4ParticleHPInelasticCompFS: re-build method two_body_reaction() to be
    used by incident charged particles (now isotropic emission in the CMS).
    Also restrict 'nresp' use below 20 MeV. Added photon emission when no
    data are available. 
  o G4ParticleHPEnAngCorrelation: deleted part of code trying to preserve
    baryon number; one has to assume that it is not preserved when using
    ENDF-6 data.
  o Fixes in G4ParticleHPKallbachMannSyst.
- models/parton_string/diffraction (hadr-string-diff-V10-05-02)
  o G4FTFParameters: extended FTF configuration interface to include parameters
    for pion projectile.
- processes (hadr-proc-V10-05-06)
  o Created new inelastic processes for heavy hadron-nucleus interactions.
    NOTE: there is no need to create similar processes for elastic heavy
    hadron-nucleus interactions; only hadrons (mesons and baryons) that can
    fly macroscopic distances are considered; for the time being, only the
    Glauber-Gribov (elastic and inelastic) cross-sections exist for these
    heavy hadrons, but not yet final-state models, therefore, currently none
    of these processes is used in any physics list.

visualization                                    vis-V10-05-21
-------------
- management (visman-V10-05-07):
  o Fixed bug in cloud drawing.
- modeling (modeling-V10-05-06):
  o Fixed setLineVisible() in '/vis/modeling'.
- OpenGL (OpenGL-V10-05-07):
  o Improved X window opening.
- Tree (vistree-V10-05-01):
  o Fixed typo in output message.

examples                                         examples-V10-05-07
--------
- Updated documentation and reference outputs.
- basic/B3 (exampleB3-V10-05-00)

    is now provided with Geant4 source and demonstrated in basic B3 abd B4d
    examples.
- extended/exoticphysics/monopole (monopole-V10-05-01)
  o Use G4Threading::IsMultithreadedApplication() instead of G4MULTITHREADED
    flag; this fixes compilation of code when used in sequential application
    built against Geant4 libraries built with MT.
- extended/eventgenerator (exEventgenerator-V10-05-01)
  o Removed GunGPS example as obsolete.
- extended/parallel/MPI (MPI-V10-05-01)
