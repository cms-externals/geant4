    in http://cern.ch/dressel/Biasing.html.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                  config-V04-00-05
------
- binmake.gmk: added entry for new module geometry/biasing. 

geometry                                geometry-V04-00-03
--------
- First release of module for importance biasing.
  Preliminary documentation can be found in the geometry Working
  Group page on Web, or directly here:
  http://cern.ch/dressel/Biasing.html.

- geometry/management                   geommng-V04-00-03 
  -------------------
  - Moved inline constructors/destructors to no inline. 
  - Enhanced behavior for destructors of volumes/solids stores.
    o Added locking mechanism for preventing conflicts when destroying
      stores and deregistering pointers. Now destructors of stores will
      also explicitely delete pointers (and therefore allocated
      volumes/solids) dynamically allocated in the user application. 
    o Added Clean() static method to volumes/solids stores to
      explicitely delete pointed objects in the stores and clear all
      entries. 
  - G4VSolid[.hh.cc]: modified G4VSolid::ClipPoligon() to consider
    clipping related to a single axis. 

- geometry/volumes                      geomvol-V04-00-06 
  ----------------
  - G4GeometryMessenger[.hh.cc]: added new commands to exploit more 
    features of the G4GeomTestVolume class for detecting geometry
    overlaps: 
    o /geometry/test/grid_test
      - runs the default grid test, same as "run". 
    o /geometry/test/recursive_test 
      - runs the grid test in recursive mode. 
    o /geometry/test/cylinder_test 
      - to shoot lines in a cylindrical pattern. 
    o /geometry/test/line_test 
      - to shoot a line according to position/direction.
  - Moved inline constructors and destructors to no inline. 

- geometry/verification                 geomver-V04-00-00 
  ---------------------
  - Moved inline constructors and destructors to no inline. 

- geometry/solids/Boolean               geom-bool-V04-00-04
  -----------------------
  - G4ReflectedSolid.cc: enhanced algorithm for CalculateExtent(). 

- geometry/solids/BREPS                 breps-V04-00-05 
  ---------------------
  - G4BREPSolidPCone.cc: added sanity check of delta phi section value
    and exception is thrown saying about this unsupported feature if
    delta phi is less than 2*PI. 

- geometry/solids/CSG                   geom-csg-V04-00-03
  -------------------
  - G4Tubs.cc: restored original "vertices" algorithm for
    CalculateExtent() which was temporarly disabled. 

global                                  global-V04-00-05
------
- Added more verbosity to G4Exception.
- G4String: use G4std::string instead of internal type 'std_string' 
  in signatures of public methods. No functional or interface changes. 

materials                               materials-V04-00-02
---------
- G4StaticSandiaData: bug fixed in Pb, added comma after 15.861
- G4Material: added G4Exception for deprecated constructor with
  chemical formula.

particles                               particles-V04-00-02
---------
- Added G4TauLeptonicDecayChannel for tau leptonic decay.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy     emlowen-V04-00-05
-----------------------------------

- Fix in G4LowEnergyPhotoElectric and G4VCrossSectionHandler for
  MeanFreePath calculation.

  G4eLowEnergyLoss.

processes/electromagnetic/standard      stand-V04-00-07
----------------------------------
- G4ComptonScattering: set LowestEnergyLimit to 1*keV.
- G4PhotoElectric: keep only Sandia crossSections, removed call to
  BuildPhysicsTables. Simplified public interface.

-------------------------------
- G4MultipleScattering: new parametrisation for angle distribution. 
  Modified boundary algorithm and some other minor fixes.

  G4OpBoundaryProcessStatus public in G4OpBoundaryProcess.

processes/transportation                transport-V04-00-05
------------------------
- Added new classes for management of biasing transportation and
  scoring.
- Added G4DEBUG_TRANSPORT flag in GNUmakefile and replaced to
  G4VERBOSE in G4Transportation::PostStepDoIt() for extra-check on
  volume boundary. Issues addressed by problem report #130 should now
  be resolved.
