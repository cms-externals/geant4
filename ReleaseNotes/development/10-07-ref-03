-------------
- management (visman-V10-07-04):
  o /vis/scene/add/volume (and /vis/drawVolume): exploit
    G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene to streamline geometry tree searches.
    Avoid calculating extent of a temporary physical volume when not
    necessary.
    The above does introduce a change of behaviour for the case that a user
    names the volume(s) requested, e.g., "/vis/drawVolume Shape1". The user
    will not normally see any difference - but it does avoid extravagant
    computation in some circumstances.
  o G4VisCommandsSet, G4VisCommandsTouchable and G4VisCommandsViewer:
    added comment of explanation where using G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene.
  o G4VisExecutive: removed deprecated Wt driver.
- modeling (modeling-V10-07-03)
  o G4PhysicalVolumesSearchScene: allow user to limit the depth of descent
    during a geometry tree search.
  o G4PhysicalVolumeModel: if opacity (alpha) == 0 (completely transparent),
    treat same as pVisAttribs->IsVisible().
- externals (visexternals-V10-07-00)
  o gl2ps: allow use of non-APPLE OpenGL on APPLE.
    To use this, build with macro GL2PS_USE_GL_GL_H.
- OpenGL (opengl-V10-07-05)
  o Implemented WindowProc() function in G4OpenGLWin32Viewer for the Win32
    OpenGL driver (function that was commented out). It is now possible to
    change the Zoom and the orientation using the mouse (like in the Qt driver).
    Based on contribution in GitHub PR#20.
  o Enable extended WIN32 window in G4OpenGLWin32Viewer.
    Based on contribution in GitHub PR#23.
  o G4OpenGLQtViewer::addNonPVSceneTreeElement(): special case for markers,
    use Info() if non-empty name appearing in Qt's scene tree. This allows
    the user to design markers, e.g., a list of points, and give them a name
    that relates to the providence of the points, e.g., a particular material
    or geometry component.
  o Removed deprecated Wt driver.
  o G4OpenGLStoredQtViewer: moved fViewId<0 check to top of constructor to
    pick up errors in base class construction.
