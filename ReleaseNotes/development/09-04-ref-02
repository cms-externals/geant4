------------------
- cross_sections (hadr-cross-V09-04-04)
  o New class G4KokoulinMuonNuclearXS: derived from code in the
    direct-implementation process G4MuNuclearInteraction, replacing the
    old-style implementation for conforming to the hadronic framework design
    of process, model, cross-section. This new class is now the default
    cross-section for G4MuonNuclearProcess.
  o G4NeutronCaptureXS: added protection for the case Ekin=0.               (o)
  o Added cross-section name to constructors, so that they can be           (o)
    retrieved for physics list print out.
  o G4CrossSectionElastic, G4CrossSectionInelastic and
    G4ComponentAntiNuclNuclearXS: adopt modified names and fixed usage in
    physics-list.
  o G4VComponentCrossSection: changed method names to
    GetTotalElementCrossSection() and GetTotalIsotopeCrossSection().
- management (hadr-man-V09-04-02)
  o G4HadronicProcess: make GetCrossSectionDataStore() public so it can be
    accessed through the process. Added method MultiplyCrossSectionBy() so
    that cross-sections can be scaled for testing.
  o Allow to turn on checking for E/p conservation by environment variables.
  o Extended Print() method in G4HadronicProcessStore to include cross-section
    info.
- models/cascade (hadr-casc-V09-04-00)                                      (o)
  o G4ElementaryParticleCollider: added protection sampleCMcosFor2to2(),
    against potential divide-by-zero. Addresses rare cases (~10^-7) of
    FP exceptions.
- models/coherent_elastic (hadr-cohe-V09-04-00)
  o G4WHadronElasticProcess: added light anti-nuclei; using particle names
    in the IfApplicable() method.
- models/de_excitation (hadr-deex-V09-04-01)
  o G4NeutronRadCapture: fixed in particle change, kill primary particle
    and save residual nucleus.
- models/parton_string (hadr-prtn-V09-04-08)
  o First implementation of barion - anti-barion annihilation.
    Added new G4FTFAnnihilation class in the FTF model, and made
    corresponding changes in related FTF classes.
    Added two new methods in G4VSplitableHadron: SetFirstParton() and
    SetSecondParton(), to set quark (anti-quark) determination at the
    annihilation.
  o Implemented simulation of anti-barion - nucleus interactions from the
    rest to 1000 GeV. Reggeon cascading is switched off.
    Good results are obtained in combination with the binary cascade model.
  o Implemented first variant of FTF code for simulation of
    anti-nucleus-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions.
    The anti-nucleus nucleus part is working starting from 150*A MeV/c.
    The nucleus-nucleus part is applicable at Plab > 2 * A GeV/c.
  o Small improvement introduced in G4FTFParameters in order to treat
    Labmda-Bar, Sigma-Bar, etc...
- models/photolepton_hadron/muon_nuclear (hadr-munuclear-V09-04-00)
  o New model G4VDMuonNuclearModel to replace old-style G4MuNuclearInteraction
    and G4ParametrizedHadronicVertex based on GHEISHA.

    active.
  o Initialize static data in G4RadioactiveDecayRate constructor.
- models/util (hadr-mod-util-V09-04-00)
  o Added new methods in G4Nucleon for creation of anti-nucleus.

  o Added G4MuonNuclearProcess, meant to replace the old process
    G4MuNuclearInteraction by separating model and cross-section classes.
  o Added processes for light anti-ions: G4AntiAlphaInelasticProcess,
    G4AntiDeuteronInelasticProcess, G4AntiHe3InelasticProcess and
    G4AntiTritonInelasticProcess.
