run                                              run-V09-06-141
---
- Fixed the logic of defining parallel scoring worlds and their corresponding
  G4ParallelWorldProcess objects for the worker threads.
  Fixed incorrect behavior in MT mode when the entire geometry is rebuilt
  from scratch.
  Fixed incorrect behavior in MT mode when a new scoring mesh is created after
  the first run.
  Added protection for multiple runs to set SD and FieldMgr for worker
  threads only if master shadow corresponding pointers are different than 0.
  Fix needed to protect against use of invalid ptr between runs.
  BuildPhysicsTables() is invoked also for a run with zero event.
- Added new method G4RunManager::ReinitializeGeometry() to correctly handle
  rebuild of geometry from scratch in users code for MT. Can optionally wipe
  out solids and volumes geometry stores.
  Fixed how G4Region split class is re-initialized for the second run; region
  information is displayed only for the master thread.
- Command '/run/beamOn' is not broadcasted to workers.
  Workers use explicitly ::RunBeamOn() method in
  G4MTRunManagerKernel::StartThread().
  UI command '/run/numberOfThreads' works only at 'PreInit' state.
- Add methods: G4RunManager::GetNumberOfEventsToBeProcessed(),
      	       G4RunManager::GetNumberOfSelectEvents(),
	       G4RunManager::GetSelectMacro()
  which return the parameters used in G4RunManager::BeamOn().
- Added G4WorkerRunManager::MergePartialResults() re-factor reduction of
  local results into global. Derived class cen re-implement reduction.
- G4MTRunManager: moved TerminateWorkers() method to be protected virtual.
  Added CreateAndStartWorkers() virtual protected method.
  All barriers are now virtual methods. Derived classes can re-implement
  synchronization of threads.
- Fix correct use of G4VUserWorkerInitialization::InitializeSteppingVerbose()
  method in G4MTRunManagerKernel::StartThread().
- Visualization manager is now registered to the worker threads at the first
  run after it is instantiated.
- Corrected deletion of memory: using free() for memory obtained with malloc()
  in G4VUPLSplitter.
  Correctly delete 'randDbl' in G4MTRunManager using delete [].
- Bug fix: reintroduced delete of worker run manager at end of 
  G4MTRunManagerKernel::StartThread() function.
- Fixes to G4MTRunManger, G4UserWorkerThreadInitialisation and
  G4VUserDetectorConstruction to allow for compilation on Windows
  in MT mode.
- Modified adjoint classes to migrate to the new RMC schema where reverse
  and forward trackings of equivalent adjoint and forward primaries are
  processed in same events. This in preparation for the migration to MT mode.

track                                            track-V09-06-04
-----
- Fixed Coverity deficts in G4Track constructors.

tracking                                         tracking-V09-06-10
--------
- New class G4AdjointTrackingAction and modified G4AdjointSteppingAction
  in order to treat the reverse tracking of an adjoint particle and tracking
  of its equivalent forward particle in the same event. This is required
  for the migration of ReverseMC to MT mode.
- G4TrackingMessenger: moved invokation with G4TransportationManager 
  from G4VisCommandsSceneAdd to this messenger; G4TransportationManager is
  now thread-local, and G4VisCommandsSceneAdd cannot access to it.
- G4SteppingManager: 'fTouchableHistory' data member is rest to zero in the
  destructor to avoid cases of double-deletion in MT mode.
- G4TrackingManager: Added handling for StoreTrajectory.

visualization                                    vis-V09-06-37
-------------
- Fixes for Coverity and PVS defects.
- management:
  o Printing brought under control of verbosity flag.
  o In /vis/touchable/set/colour and several other commands parameter
    guidance may be called only once. So instances of multiple calls to
    parameter guidance have been eliminated.
    Any extended information that was in parameter guidance has been moved
    to command guidance. This fixes a problem whereby guidance information
    was being lost and fixes a crash in the GAG interface.
  o Moved invocation of G4TransportationManager in G4VisCommandsSceneAdd
    to G4TrakingMessenger.
  o Fixed event keeping in MT mode.
  o /vis/scene/add/date: changed positioning.
  o Command parameters updates.
- modeling:
  o Make use of G4GenericPolycone in G4ArrowModel.
- OpenGL (opengl-V09-06-12):
  o Fixes to enable support for Wt.
  o Fixed bug in the G4OpenGLQtViewer allowing for visualization on Qt-5.    (+)
