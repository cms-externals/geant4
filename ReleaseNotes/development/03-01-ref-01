                       ===================

Some of the fixes/development included since the last reference
tag are:

  - Migration of 'geometry' code to STL vector, removed
    all references to RW wrappers.
  - Extended implementation of HepPolyhedron to cover unforeseen
    cases during preselection of faces without intersection. 
  - Fixes for run-time memory leaks of hadronic processes.
  - Fixes in G4ParticleDefinition::GetPDGIsospin().
  - Introduced first version of visualization ASCIITree to
    dump geometry hierarchy to standard output as ASCII stream. 

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                          config-V03-01-00
------
- Added G4VIS_BUILD_ASCIITREE_DRIVER and G4VIS_USE_ASCIITREE to
  G4VIS*.gmk.

geometry                        geometry-V03-01-00
--------
- Migrated code to native STL vector. Removed all references to
  Rogue-Wave wrappers.
- G4Trap: fixed memory leak in CalculateExtent() for creation of
  vertices in case of finite rotation. 

graphics_reps                   greps-V03-01-00
-------------
- Fixes in HepPolyhedron:
  o Extended implementation to cover unforeseen earlier situation 
    during preselection of faces without intersection. 
  o Fixed warnings about possible use of uninitialized variables. 
  o Made GetNumberOfRotationSteps() static and public.

particles/management            partman-V03-00-04
--------------------
- Added a0(980),f0(400-1200),f0(980).
- Fixed bugs in G4ParticleDefinition::GetPDGIsospin().
- Fixed element name in G4IonTable.
- Fixed PDG encoding for excited Lambdas.
- Added special treatment for Lamdas in G4PDGCodeChecker.

persistency                     persistency_STL-V03-01-00
-----------
- Removed useless declaration of typedef G4ThreeVectorList.

processes/hadronic/management   hadronic_man-V03-01-00
-----------------------------
- Fixes memory leak in G4InelasticInteraction:
  o systematic search for leaks - energy scan 50MeV-10GeV. 

processes/hadronic/model/high_energy    had_mod_high-V03-01-00
------------------------------------
- Introduced temporary workaround in G4HEInelastic for high energy
  problem (number of particles created in one event larger than
  allocation). 

processes/hadronic/model/generator/pre_equilibrium    preequ-V03-00-01
--------------------------------------------------
- Introduced many improvements on angular distributions.

processes/hadronic/model/radiative_decay     radiative_decay-V03-01-00
----------------------------------------
- Fixes to cowork with STL vector migration of 'geometry'.
processes/hadronic/util         hadronic_util-V03-01-01
-----------------------
- Fixed memory leak in G4ReactionDynamics:
  o systematic search for leaks - energy scan verification 50MeV-10GeV 

event                   event-V03-01-00
-----
- Fixes to cowork with STL vector migration of 'geometry'.

visualization                   vis-V03-01-00
-------------
- Added two new commands:
    /vis/scene/add/text
    /vis/scene/add/axes
- Introduced first version of ASCIITree to dump geometry hierarchy
  to standard output as ASCII stream. 
  This requires two new environment variables:
  G4VIS_BUILD_ASCIITREE_DRIVER and G4VIS_USE_ASCIITREE.

examples                        examples-V03-01-00
--------
- Updated reference outputs.
- Migrated novice/N05 to STL vector.
- Added new interactive commands in extended/electromagnetic/TestEm5.

tests                           tests-V03-01-01
-----
- Updated reference outputs.
