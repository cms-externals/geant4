                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Added treatment of G4UnknownParticle for bosons and G4UnknownDecay.
  o Added new class G4EmCalculator used to access and compute dedx, range,
    and cross sections for electromagnetic processes.
  o Introduced force auxiliary edge visible in G4VisAttributes and
    G4ViewParameters to allow for visualization of wireframe for
    curved shapes.
  o Removed deprecated visualization commands.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

event                                            events-V06-02-01
-----
- Added treatment of G4UnknownParticle to G4PrimaryTransformer.

geometry/divisions                               geomdiv-V06-02-01
------------------
- Removed unnecessary debug printout in method
  G4PVDivision::CheckAndSetParamenters().

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V06-02-02
-------------------
- Fix in G4Cons::DistanceToIn(p,v) on fRmax surface and move in,
  the condition became a bit more strict && determinant >=0, i.e.
  intersections in addition to go in.
  Fixes a rare problem of dIn=dOut=0 observed in 3 events over a
  statistics of 10^8..
- Fix in G4Sphere::DistanceToOut(p,v,...) on fRmin moving outside.
  The bug showed 3 events of dIn=dOut=0 for 10^7 statistics in the
  unit testing.

graphics_reps                                    greps-V06-02-00
-------------
- Introduced force auxiliary edge visible in G4VisAttributes.

particles                                        particles-V06-02-00
---------

processes/decay                                  decay-V06-02-00
---------------
- Introduced G4UnknownDecay class.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  utils-V06-02-04
-------------------------------
- Added G4EmCalculator, a class to access/compute dedx, range, cross
  sections of electromagnetic processes.
- Added G4ionEffectiveCharge class needed for ion physics.
- Fixed a problem of cut dependence of transmission energy of low energy
  electrons via thin foil.
- Fixed a problem observed when deactivating muon ionisation.

processes/electromagnetic/xrays                  xrays-V06-02-02
-------------------------------
- Changed "StronglyForced" back to "Forced" in GetMeanLifeTime() for
  G4Scintillation process.
- Substituted obsolete iterfaces to G4ParticleDefinition.

processes/optical                                op-V06-02-00
-----------------
- Allow for unified model reflectivity parameters to also work in case
  of dielectric_metal surfaces; addresses in part problem report #654.

processes/transportation                         transport-V06-02-00
------------------------
- Introduced G4StepLimiter to handle MaxAllowedStep in G4UserLimits.

visualization                                    vis-V06-02-02
-------------
- Removed deprecated commands:
    /vis/viewer/show               (use /vis/viewer/update)
    /vis/viewer/lightsThetaPhi     (use /vis/viewer/set/lightsThetaPhi)
    /vis/viewer/lightsVector       (use /vis/viewer/set/lightsVector)
    /vis/viewer/viewpointThetaPhi  (use /vis/viewer/set/viewpointThetaPhi)
    /vis/viewer/viewpointVector    (use /vis/viewer/set/viewpointVector)
  (See geant4/source/visualization/README.built_in_commands for list
  of current commands.)
- Added auxiliary edge visible flag to G4ViewParameters and a new
  command, /vis/viewer/set/auxiliaryEdge.  (Auxiliary edges are not
  genuine edges of the volume.  They may be in a curved surface made
  out of polygons, for example, or in plane surface of complicated
  shape that has to be broken down into simpler polygons.
  HepPolyhedron breaks all surfaces into triangles or quadrilaterals.
  There will be auxiliary edges for any volumes with a curved surface,
  such as a tube or a sphere, or a volume resulting from a Boolean
  operation.  Normally, they are not shown, but sometimes it is useful
  to see them.  In particular, a sphere, because it has no egdes, will
  not be seen in wireframe mode in some graphics systems unless this
  flag is turned on).
  Implemented force auxiliary edge visible feature of G4VisAttributes.
- Refined forced wireframe algorithm: *always* force wireframe even
  if hidden line removal is specified.
- Cosmetics to OpenGL driver.
- Small improvements to G4XXX (sample graphics system).
- Tidied guidance for /vis/viewer/set.
- HepRep (vis-HepRep-V06-02-01):
  fixed a compilation problem in zlib for AMD64.
