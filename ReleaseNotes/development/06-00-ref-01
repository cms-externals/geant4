                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Migrated EM standard physics processes to use existing specialised
    version of particle-change, G4ParticleChangeForLoss. Activated more
    precise range calculations.
  o Fixed problems of deep "under mass shell" in CHIPS.
  o Fixes for memory leaks in Penelope low-energy physics models.
  o Relaxed exceptions in CSG solids for rare conditions in DistanceToOut().

-------------------
- Converted strong exceptions in warning notifications for rare anomalous
  conditions in DistanceToOut(p,v,..).
- G4Cons: bug fix in DistanceToIn(p,v) to resolve situations of calls
  to DistanceToOut() for points outside.

geometry/solids/specific                geom-specific-V06-00-00
------------------------
- G4PolyhedraSide: fixed bug in which particles could "leak" out the
  center of a face if inner radius = 0. Fixes problem report #547.

geometry/solids/tests                   geom-solids-tests-V06-00-00
---------------------
- Added SolidsChecker test suite.

geometry/volumes                        geomvol-V06-00-00
----------------
- G4AssemblyVolume: fixed initial value for 'numberOfDaughters' of
  imprinted volumes copy-numbers. Fixes problem report #566.

global                                  global-V06-00-00
------
- G4UnitsTable: corrected signatures to consider 'const G4String&'
  wherever applicable.

materials                               materials-V06-00-00
---------
- G4Material: proper STL handling of 'theElementVector'.

particles                               particles-V06-00-00
---------
- Fixed initialization problems in G4NuclearPropertiesTable:
  o Added initialization of 'indexArray'.
  o Removed internal static member 'theInstance'.

processes/electromagnetic/lowenergy              emlowen-V06-00-00
-----------------------------------
- Fixed memory leaks in G4PenepoleInterpolator and G4PenelopeIonisation.

processes/electromagnetic/muons                  muons-V06-00-00
-------------------------------
- Migrated processes to use G4ParticleChangeForLoss.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               stand-V06-00-01
----------------------------------
- Migrated processes to use G4ParticleChangeForLoss.
- Minor fix in G4PAIonisation.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  utils-V06-00-03
-------------------------------
- Activated precise range calculation.
- Add Set methods to G4LossTablemanager to define: binning,
  'maxEnergy' for muon tables, 'maxEnergy' for precise range.
- Migrated processes to use G4ParticleChangeForLoss.
- Fixed problem in destruction of PAI model.

processes/.../chiral_inv_phase_space/body        ghad-chips-body-V06-00-00
-----------------------------------------
- Fixed problems of deep "under mass shell" in CHIPS.
  This is the last tag before a major change in which the
  Lepton/HyperFragments nuclear fragments (not only Lambda hyperfragments,
  but Neutron, Sigma-, Proton, Sigma+ nuclear fragments etc) are going to be
  added to the CHIPS World. Leptons must be added to CHIPS to simulate the
  muon capture and the (nu,mu) reactions. If people are using standard CHIPS 
  Q-codes (instead of the PDG Codes), which are defined in the CHIPS Manual,
  they must be careful as all Q-codes are going to be changed -after- this tag! 

processes/.../models/parton_string/qgsm          ghad-qgsm-V06-00-00
---------------------------------------
- Fixed trivial compilation warning.

processes/parameterisation                       param-V06-00-00
--------------------------
- G4FastSimulationVector.icc: use std_pvector:: scope for calls to
  base class. Fixes compilation problem on Intel-icc compiler.

track                                            track-V06-00-01
-----
- Update G4ParticleChangeForLoss for utilisation in G4VEnergyLossProcess.
- Minor update G4ParticleChangeForMSC for utilisation in model design of msc.
- Change of volume in G4ParticleChangeForTransportation only if kinEnergy>0.
- G4VParticleChange: removed unnecessary 'const' qualifier to return value
  in GetAccuracyForWarning() and GetAccuracyForException() causing noisy
  compilation warnings on Intel-icc compiler.

tracking                                         tracking-V06-00-00
--------
- Removed obsolete action for G4UserLimits in
  G4SteppingManager::DefinePhysicalStepLength().
