                       ===================

Some of the development/fixes included since the last reference tag are:

  o Fix in G4IntersectionSolid::DistanceToIn(p,v) to allow for correct
    simmetrical treatment of the solids' intersection.
  o Added ability to assign G4UserLimits per detector region.
  o Introduced new classes to retrieve material properties from NIST
    database.

---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:


geometry/management                              geommng-V07-00-00
-------------------
- Added G4UserLimits pointer to G4Region and added access from
  G4LogicalVolume.
- Added optional boolean argument 'propagate' to GetMass() to avoid
  propagation of computation of masses to the daughter volumes.
  Propagation to daughters is done by default.

geometry/solids/Boolean                          geom-bool-V07-00-01
-----------------------
- Fix in G4IntersectionSolid::DistanceToIn(p,v) to allow for correct
  simmetrical treatment of the solids' intersection. Algorithm reviewed
  as proposed in problem report #723.
- Modified Inside(p) G4SubtractionSolid and G4UnionSolid, to fix
  inconsistency for non-zero sum of surface-normals.
  Currently available only through activation of G4NEW_SURF_NORMAL
  compilation flag.
- Changed AddThis() to AddSolid() in the concrete implementations of
  DescribeYourselfTo(G4VGraphicsScene&) for all solids. Use the newly
  available CreatePolyhedron() for components of Boolean solids, instead
  of GetPolyhedron().
- New unit test testBoolSurfaceInOut and updates.

geometry/solids/BREPS                            breps-V07-00-00
---------------------
- Changed AddThis() with AddSolid() in DescribeYourselfTo()
  implementation for G4BREPSolid and G4BREPSolidOpenPCone.

geometry/solids/CSG                              geom-csg-V07-00-01
-------------------
- New alternative implementation of SurfaceNormal(p) with edges/vertices
  for G4Box, G4Para, G4Trap, G4Trd. Old implementation is still the default.
  Currently it can be activated only by setting G4NEW_SURF_NORMAL variable
  before compilation.
- Changed AddThis() with AddSolid() for all solids in DescribeYourselfTo()
  implementation.

geometry/solids/specific                         geom-specific-V07-00-01
------------------------
- Fixed compilation warnings on WIN32-VC for G4VSurface.

global                                           global-V07-00-02
------
- Migrated calls to G4Exception in HEPNumerics to canonical signature.
- Q/A cleanup to clear CodeWizard warnings and minor fixes.
- Moved inline methods to .icc files.
- Fixed compilation warnings on WIN32-VC for G4JTPolynomialSolver;
  removed unnecessary inclusion of <cfloat>.
- Minor cosmetics.

graphics_reps                                    greps-V07-00-01
-------------
- HepPolyhedron: added IsErrorBooleanProcess().
- BooleanProcessor: added get_processor_error().
- G4Visible: moved SetVisAttributes() to non-inline and added warning
  message.
- Added G4VisExtent::NullExtent.

---------
- New classes to retrieve material properties from NIST database:
  G4NistManager, G4NistMessenger, G4NistElementBuilder,
  G4NistMaterialBuilder, G4NistMaterialManager
- New unit tests G4NistMaterialTest1 and G4NistMaterialTest2.

processes/electromagnetic/standard               stand-V07-00-02
----------------------------------
- Added new development classes G4hIonisation70 and G4ionIonisation70.

processes/electromagnetic/utils                  utils-V07-00-02
-------------------------------
- Fixed bug in the initialisation of G4VEmProcess.
- Shifted verbose level: set default value to 1.
- Add flags "ApplyCuts" and "KillPrimary" to G4VEmProcess.
- Added new class G4EmCorrections for the calculation of EM corrections
  to ionisation.

processes/hadronic/models/readioactive_decay     radioactive_decay-V07-00-00  
--------------------------------------------
- Minor correction to G4NuclearDeceyChannel to fix bug #711.

processes/transportation                         transport-V07-00-00
------------------------
- Added virtual to destructors of G4StepLimiter and G4UserSpecialCuts.
