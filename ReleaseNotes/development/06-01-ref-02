---------- Reference-tag 'Release Notes' -----------

Summarised, the list of changes is the following:

config                                           config-V06-01-03
------
- binmake.gmk: fixed problem for WIN32 such that also LDLIBS (including
  EXTRALIBS) will be mangled to replace -L by its WIN32 correspondance
  libpath.
- Added new experimental setup for Linux-g++ using -O2 optimisation
  as default. To trigger this setup G4SYSTEM must be set to "Linux-gO2".
  It also includes (deactivated by default) Pentium4 chip specific options
  for using chips-specific floating-point arithmetics based on the SSE unit.
- architecture.gmk: revisited Inventor default. Removed HEPVis dependencies
  (Inventor visualization driver does not need these libraries any longer).
- Darwin-g++.gmk:
  o Corrected options to build shared libraries (.dyn); now using
    "-dynamic -single_module" to have faster startup when Geant4 is
    embedded in an external framework.
  o Corrected options to retrieve Motif.
