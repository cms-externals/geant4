                 Geant4 11.0 - patch-01 Release Notes
                 ------------------------------------

                                                             8 March 2022

List of fixes included in this public patch since the public release 11.0:

  o Configuration
    -------------
    + CMake:
      o Adding missing G4ptl and G4tasking libraries to link list in
        geant4-config script. Addressing GitHub PR#37.

  o Analysis:
    --------
    + Fix in notifying about closing file in G4GenericAnalysisManager.

  o Externals:
    ---------
    + Fix in CMAke script to export built-in PTL include directory to include
      path list for use of geant4-config.

  o Geometry:
    --------
    + solids/Boolean:
      o In G4MultiUnion, added alternative signature for AddNode() taking a
        pointer to solid. Added 'const' qualification to transformation passed
        as argument. Addressing problem report #2457.

  o Global:
    ------
    + G4String: provide overload G4String::operator[](int) to workaround MSVC
      compiler error C2666. Addressing problem report #2463.
    + Updated date and version for 11.0.1.

  o Intercoms:
    ---------
    + Check and set proper argument types for each individual argument when
      G4GenericMessenger::DeclareMethod() is used.
      Addressing problem report #2420.

  o Materials:
    ---------
    + G4MaterialPropertiesTable: set G4MaterialPropertyVector verbosity to 1.
    + G4DensityEffectData: fixed typos in the density effect data table for 8
      materials; the most significant fix is for G4_Tm; of minor entity for
      G4_Be, G4_Mg, G4_Fe, and G4_Y. Addressing problem report #2423.
    + G4SandiaTable: fixed compilation warning on unused variable.

  o Persistency:
    -----------
    + ASCII:
      o Corrected wrong automatic conversion degree-radian for G4Polycone phi
        angle parameter. Based on GitHub PR#36.

  o Physics Lists:
    -------------
    + constructors/electromagnetic
      o G4EmStandardPhysics_option3: use options providing more accurate 
        simulation without loss of CPU performance: set RangeFactor to 0.03;
        use 'SafetyPlus' step limitation instead of 'DistanceToBoundary'.
        Significantly improving fanoCavity results.

  o Processes - Electromagnetic:
    ---------------------------
    + low-energy
      o G4MicroElecInelasticModel_new: changed interpolate() method; making a
        choice between log-log, lin-log, and lin-lin interpolations and added a
        protection for zero input energy. When sampling transition, the choice
        is implemented for transition from atomic level and Fermi level.
        Should fix rare crash observed in this model.
      o Prefer pointer to 'const G4Material' where possible.
      o G4hIonEffChargeSquare, G4PenelopeRayleighModel,
        G4PenelopeRayleighModelMI: fixed compilation warning on unused variable.
    + standard
      o G4UniversalFluctuation: introduced new protected method SampleGlandz(),
        which provides sampling of non-Gauss fluctuations; improved arithmetics;
        same results as in release 11.0.0.
      o G4UrbanFluctuation: reorganized version of fluctuation model from
        release 10.7 in SampleGlandz() method.
      o G4UniversalFluctuation, G4UrbanFluctuation: use the same fw=4 and a0=42
        parameters of the model providing similar fluctuation results for small
        steps in thin layers as in version 10.7.
        Addressing problem report #2466.
      o G4LossFluctuationDummy: new class with zero fluctuations.
      o G4UrbanMscModel: minor optimisation of arithmetics. Removed multiple
        initialisation of the cache data structure and possible data race.
      o G4CoulombScattering: for single scattering used in restricted interval
        of large angles, use 'fEmIncreasing' type of cross-section shape.
    + utils
      o G4VEmProcess: fixed methods where implementation is based on assumption
        that the lambda table is defined for full energy range:
        LambdaPhysicsVector(..), CrossSEctionPerVolume(..), FindLambdaMax(..).
        No change is expected for the default physics configuration; fix mainly
        affecting positron annihilation processes at high energies. 
      o G4VMscModel, G4VEmProcess: move few methods and header files from
        header to source in order to reduce dependencies between packages.
      o G4EmParametersMessenger: added forgotten UI command to enable
        polarisation.
      o Added info in 'setMaxBetaChange' command description.
    + xrays
      o Fix in 'MaxBetaChange' value in Cerenkov process.
        Addressing problem report #2456.
      o G4Scintillation: removed unused 'YieldFactor' declarations.
        Addressing problem report #2470.

  o Processes - Generic:
    -------------------
    + cuts
      o G4VRangeToEnergyConverter: fixed construction/destruction of static
        data.
    + optical
      o Removed G4lrint/G4lint to calculate angle bin for Davis/LBNL LUT;
        fixes crash when angle = 0.

  o Processes - Hadronic:
    --------------------
    + cross_sections
      o G4ComponentAntiNuclNuclearXS: correct treatment of the cross-sections
        of light anti-nuclei on hydrogen target. This relies on the isospin
        symmetry assumption, according to which the properties of the reactions
        between anti-proton and light nuclei are equivalent to those between
        light anti-nuclei and hydrogen.
    + models/coherent_elastic
      o G4AntiNuclElastic: correction in SampleInvariantT() method of the
        highest momentum transfer (which was causing the cosine of the polar
        angle in the center-of-mass system to be larger than 1 in some cases).
        Addressing problem report #2204.
    + models/inclxx
      o G4INCLXXInterface: fixed treatment of kaon0, anti_kaon0, kaon0L, and
        kaon0S. In current reference physics lists, INCLXX is never used for
        handling kaons, although it is capable of doing so, but at process-
        level or in custom physics lists one could observe crashes when trying
        to use INCLXX for neutral kaon projectiles. The change fixes this
        misbehavior.

  o Run
    ---
    + Fixed missing 'AnnihToTauTau' entry from default physics list ordering
      that would cause a fatal exception if 'EmExtra' is used with
      PositronToMuMu=True.
    + Adding verbosity control to some printouts to standard output.
      Addressing problem report #2397.

  o Tasking
    -------
    + Fixing number of seeds to be generated for the case when seeds from
      master are seeded only once per task.
    + Adding verbosity control to some printouts to standard output.
      Addressing problem report #2397.

  o Examples:
    --------
    + extended/medical/fanoCavity
    + extended/medical/fanoCavity2
      o Make PhysicsLists coherent with main physics_list library.
    + extended/optical/OpNovice
      o Fixed incorrect call to G4MaterialPropertiesTable::AddProperty().
        Added comments explaining use.
