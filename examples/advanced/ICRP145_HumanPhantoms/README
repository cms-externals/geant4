1- HOW TO BUILD AND RUN THE EXAMPLES
  
  The example codes were tested in Geant4.10.06 or higher versions.
  
  Please note that the guides below are based on Linux/MacOSX, which are the
  recommended platforms for Geant4.
  
  1) Compile and link to generate an executable (with CMake)
  
        % cd path_to_example    # go either to 'External' or 'Internal' folder
        % mkdir example_build 
        % cd example_build
        % cmake ..
        % make
  
  2) How to run
  
    a) 'External'

        % ./External [options]
        
        Options:
        -m [input file name]    optional provided->batch mode
                                         not provided->interactive mode
        -o [output file name]   optional (default: [macro file name].out)
        -f                      optional  switch to change the phantom to MRCP-AF
                                          (default: MRCP-AM)
          
          ex) MRCP-AM: % ./External -m example.in -o example.out
          ex) MRCP-AF: % ./External -m example.in -o example.out -f 
          
    b) 'Internal'  
    
        % ./Internal [options]

        Options:
        -i [ID of source organ] mandatory (ID of each organ can be found in Appendix A)
        -m [input file name]    optional  provided->batch mode
                                          not provided->interactive mode
        -o [output file name]   optional  (default: [macro file name].out)
        -f                      optional  switch to change the phantom to MRCP-AF
                                          (default: MRCP-AM)

          ex) MRCP-AM: % ./Internal -i 9500 -m example.in -o example.out
          ex) MRCP-AF: % ./Internal -i 9500 -m example.in -o example.out -f 
          
    c) Notes
    
      - Regarding to interactive mode with visualisation:
         
         * you can run the codes in interactive mode with visualisation by 
           omitting -m option.
         * the memory required for the visualisation is ~35 GB when the code is
           run on a single thread. (it is less than 10 GB in batch mode)
         * in interactive mode, user should start a run by using 
           /run/beamOn command. (Idle> /run/beamOn [number of events])
          
      - Regarding to source definition:
         
         * 'External'- source can be specified in source.mac file by using
                       macro commands for G4GeneralParticleSource (/gps/).
         * 'Internal'- source organ can be defined by using -i option.
                     - source particle and the particle energy can be specified
                       in source.mac file by using macro commands for 
                       G4ParticlGun (/gun/).
         * physics list may need to be modified according to the particular needs.
           (please note that physics list in this example is not same to the one
           used for the production of the dose coefficients provided in this 
           Publication.)
          
      - Regarding to multi-threaded mode:
         
         * these examples can be run in multi-threaded mode when Geant4 was 
           compiled in multi-threaded mode.
         * the number of threads can be set in input file (see example.in)
         
      - Regarding to the path to phantom data:
       
         * the default path to phantom data is "(build_directory)/../../phantoms".
         * to specify the path please change a PHANTOM_PATH environment variable.
           (export PHANTOM_PATH="path_to_phantom_data")
          
 
2- RESULT FILE

  example_male.out and example_female.out files in each folder is the result file
  for example.in. The result file provides absorbed doses for all organ IDs for TM 
  model listed in Appendix A.
