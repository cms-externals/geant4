                            transforms 
                            ----------

 There are two G4PVPlacement constructors. One uses the direct rotation matrix,
 via G4Transform3D class. The other uses inverse rotation matrix.
 The rotation matrix themselves, direct or inverse, can be explicitely computed
 by users, or build with various G4 build-in transformations methods,
 like axial rotations.
 This example illustrates various ways to place a volume.

 1- Geometry construction
    ---------------------
 Two G4Trd volumes (daughters) are placed within a G4Tubs (mother), as shown
 in picture rotm.jpg
 
 The various ways of placement are implemented in the DetectorConstruction class
 in the following private functions:
 
 - PlaceWithDirectMatrix()
 - PlaceWithInverseMatrix()
 - PlaceWithAxialRotations()
 - PlaceWithEulerAngles()
 - PlaceWithReflections()
 
 which are then called from the Construct() function.
 All methods define exactly same geometry except for the placement 
 with reflection where trapezoids are placed with their symmetry axis 
 in parallel with z-axis in order to make easier to check reflection 
 visually. 

 The method of placement can be selected interactively via the command
 (see DetectorMessenger):
 /placement/setMethod method (see transfoms.in)

      
 2- Physics list
    ------------
 PhysicsList.cc defines only geantino and transportation process.
         	
 3- Primary generator
    ----------------- 
 Default kinematic is a geantino at coordinate origin.
 Can be changed with particleGun commands.
         	
 4- Physics
    -------
 No physics; only transportation.
  	
 5- Visualisation
    ------------- 
 Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 Initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 /vis/.. in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from the main 
 in case of interactive running mode.
  
 6- How to start ?
    -------------- 
  - execute transforms in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 	% transforms
 	....
 	Idle>   ---> type your commands. For instance:
	Idle> /placement/setMethod WithInverseMatrix
	Idle> /tracking/verbose 1 		
	Idle> /run/beamOn 1
	....				
 	Idle> exit
 		
  - execute transforms in 'batch' mode from macro files
 	% transforms   transforms.in
