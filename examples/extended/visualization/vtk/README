                            Example vtk
                            -----------

 This example demonstrates VTK visualisation driver. The code is based on
 the basic/B1 example, although the geometry has been modified. The physical
 example is a concerete dump, so a cuboid with a cylindrical hole removed.

 VTK has some visualisation commands which are not applicable to all viewers,
 which currently include cutters, clippers and geometry overlays. The VTK commands
 are in vtk.mac and you can explore apply different VTK only commands.

 A- VISUALISATION

This example is really for demonstration of VTK and so the easiest way to start with

% G4VIS_DEFAULT_DRIVER=VtkQt ./exampleVtk

or

% G4UI_USE_TCSH=1 G4VIS_DEFAULT_DRIVER=VtkNative ./exampleVtk

The event loop for the UI can be blocked by the VtkNative window. So if input events
are captured by VTK, then the easiest way to exit from the viewer is to hit the 'q' button,
then you are returned to the shell UI. To restart interaction then issue the command

Idle> /vis/vtk/startInteractor

 B- USER INTERFACES

VTK can be used in conjunction with all UI systems. If a shell UI is used event loop for the UI can be blocked
by the VtkNative window. So if input events are captured by VTK, then the easiest way to
exit from the viewer is to hit the 'q' button, then you are returned to the shell UI.
To restart interaction then issue the command

Idle> /vis/vtk/startInteractor

 C- HOW TO RUN

Starting with VTK

% G4VIS_DEFAULT_DRIVER=VtkQt ./exampleVtk

Executing VTK specific commands

Idle> /control/execute vtk.mac
