VTK is a graphical pipeline
(https://book.vtk.org/en/latest/VTKBook/04Chapter4.html#pipeline-design-and-implementation)
based renderer. There are various pipelines and the state of the
pipelines can be displayed by issuing this command

\verbatim
/vis/vtk/printDebug
\endverbatim

Pipelines can be switched during operation. This is performed by calling

\verbatim
/vis/vtk/set/polyhedronPipeline (append/tensor/bake/separate)
\endverbatim

and then a subsequent

\verbatim
/vis/viewer/flush
\endverbatim

There is significantly different performance between these pipelines. Append, tensor
and bake are all designed for large models and high performance. Separate creates
a pipeline for each polyhedron, each pipeline will ultimately end with a draw call.
In general with modern pipelined shaders draw calls should be kept to a minimum.

For debugging the VTK viewer it is possible to place a head up display (HUD) which
gives key information on the viewer performance. The HUD is enabled by issuing

\verbatim
/vis/vtk/set/hud 1
\endverbatim
