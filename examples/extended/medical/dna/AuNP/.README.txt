\section AuNP_s1 INTRODUCTION

  The AuNP example simulates the track-structure of electrons 
  in microscopic gold volume.The example also simulates that 
  in liquid water medium surrunding the gold volume.

  The details of the physics models are described in the following paper:
  J. Appl. Phys. 120 (2016) 244901

  The details of the application are described in the following paper:
  Phys. Med. 63 (2019) 98-104
  Med. Phys. 45(5) (2018) 2230-2242

\section AuNP_s2 GEOMETRY DEFINITION

  The geometry is a sphere (World) made of liquid water containing a smaller 
  sphererical target volume of Gold.

  The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class.

\section AuNP_s3 PHYSICS LIST

  The default physics list is constructed in PhysicsList class.

  The details of the physics models are described in the following paper:
  J. Appl. Phys. 120 (2016) 244901

\section AuNP_s4  ACTION INITALIZATION

  The class ActionInitialization instantiates and registers
  to Geant4 kernel all user action classes.

  While in sequential mode the action classes are instantiated just once,
  via invoking the method
      ActionInitialization::Build()
  in multi-threading mode the same method is invoked for each thread worker
  and so all user action classes are defined thread-local.

  A run action class is instantiated both thread-local
  and global that's why its instance is created also in the method
      ActionInitialization::BuildForMaster()
  which is invoked only in multi-threading mode.

\section AuNP_s5 AN EVENT: PRIMARY GENERATOR

  The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting from the
  hemi-sphere of gold volume (the position is randomely selected).
  The type of the particle and its energy are set in the
  PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can be changed via the G4 build-in
  commands of G4ParticleGun class.

\section AuNP_s6 DETECTOR RESPONSE : Scorers

\subsection CHEM6_s6_sub1 Species scorer

  This scorer computes following quantities.

  - the energy spectra of secondary particles generated in AuNP
  - the energy spectra of secondary particles at AuNP surface
  - the energy spectra of secondary particles generated in liquid water
  - the energy deposit and the position in the absorber surrunding AuNP

  Run::RecordEvent(), called at end of event, collects informations
  event per event from the hits collections, and accumulates statistic for
  RunAction::EndOfRunAction().

  In multi-threading mode the statistics accumulated per workers is merged
  to the master in Run::Merge().

  The information is scored in a ROOT ntuple file AuNP.root.
  
\section AuNP_s7 OUTPUT

  Physics initialization and the defined reaction table are printed.

\section AuNP_s9 RELEVANT MACRO FILES

  Two user macro files can be used:

\verbatim
./AuNP -mac AuNP.mac
\endverbatim

\section CHEM6_s10 PLOT

  Two root macros can be used:

\verbatim
root plot.C
\endverbatim
