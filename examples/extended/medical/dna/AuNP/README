---->0. INTRODUCTION.                                                    
                                                                       
The AuNP example simulates the track-structure of electrons in microscopic gold volume.
The example also simulates that in liquid water medium surrunding the gold volume.


This example is provided by the Geant4-DNA collaboration.

These processes and models are further described at:
http://geant4-dna.org

Any report or published results obtained using the Geant4-DNA software shall 
cite the following Geant4-DNA collaboration publications:

Med. Phys. 37 (2010) 4692-4708

We also suggest these other references related to this example:

---->1. GEOMETRY SET-UP.
  
The geometry is a sphere (World) made of liquid water containing a smaller sphererical target volume of Gold.

Make sure G4LEDATA points to the low energy electromagnetic libraries.

The code can be compiled with cmake.

It works in MT mode.

---->3. HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE                                         

Run:
./AuNP AuNP.mac

---->4. PHYSICS

This example shows:
- how to use the Geant4-DNA processes for gold
- how to count and save occurrences of processes

Look at the PhyscisList.cc file.

---->5. SIMULATION OUTPUT AND RESULT ANALYSIS                                    

The output results consists in an AuNP.root file, containing for the run:
- the energy spectra of secondary particles generated in AuNP
- the energy spectra of secondary particles at AuNP surface
- the energy spectra of secondary particles generated in liquid water
- the energy deposit and the position in the absorber surrunding AuNP


This file can be easily analyzed using for example the provided ROOT macro 
file plot.C; to do so :
* be sure to have ROOT installed on your machine
* be sure to be in the microdosimetry directory
* launch ROOT by typing root
* under your ROOT session, type in : .X plot.C to execute the macro file
* alternatively you can type directly under your session : root plot.C
