 Examples in this directory demonstrate how to make histograms and ntuples

\link ExampleAnaEx01 AnaEx01 \endlink

 Simple example showing use of g4tools.

\link ExampleAnaEx02 AnaEx02 \endlink

 As AnaEx01, but direct interface to ROOT.
  
\link ExampleAnaEx03 AnaEx03 \endlink

 As AnaEx01, showing basic features common to all AIDA implementations.

\link ExampleB1Con B1Con \endlink

 B1Con shows how to use the statistical tool G4ConvergenceTester.
 It does not make histograms.
 It has the same geometry as B1.

\link ExampleB3aScoreWriter B3aScoreWriter \endlink

 This example demonstrates saving the Geant4 scorers hits in form of ntuples in a Root 
 file using Geant4 analysis tools. 

\link ExampleB4dScoreWriter B4dScoreWriter  \endlink

 This example demonstrates saving the Geant4 scorers hits in form of ntuples in a Root 
 file using Geant4 analysis tools. 
 In difference from the B3aScoreWriter example, the G4AnalysisManager is explicitly used 
 in this example and the ntuples with scorers hits are saved in addition to the histograms 
 and ntuples created in B4RunAction.
