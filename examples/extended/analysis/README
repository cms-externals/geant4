                -----------------------------------

 Examples in this directory demonstrate how to make histograms and ntuples

AnaEx01
--------

 Simple example showing use of g4tools.

AnaEx02
--------

 As AnaEx01, but direct interface to ROOT.
  
AnaEx03
--------

 As AnaEx01, showing basic features common to all AIDA implementations.

B1Con
------

 B1Con shows how to use the statistical tool G4ConvergenceTester.
 It does not make histograms.
 It has the same geometry as B1.

B3aScoreWriter
--------------

 This example demonstrates saving the Geant4 scorers hits in form of ntuples in a Root 
 file using Geant4 analysis tools. 

B3aScoreWriter
--------------

 This example demonstrates saving the Geant4 scorers hits in form of ntuples in a Root 
 file using Geant4 analysis tools. 
 In difference from the B3aScoreWriter example, the G4AnalysisManager is explicitly used 
 in this example and the ntuples with scorers hits are saved in addition to the histograms 
 and ntuples created in B4RunAction.
